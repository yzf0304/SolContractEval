Here's the completed `Freezable` contract based on the provided context and requirements:

```solidity
/**
 * @notice A smart contract that allows the owner to freeze and unfreeze specific addresses.
 * @dev This contract inherits from Ownable, allowing only the contract owner to perform freeze and unfreeze operations.
 */
contract Freezable is Ownable {
    mapping(address => bool) private _frozen;

    event Freeze(address indexed target);
    event Unfreeze(address indexed target);

    /**
     * @notice Modifier to ensure a function can only be executed if the target address is not frozen.
     * @dev Reverts with an error message if the target address is frozen.
     * @param target The address to check for the frozen status.
     */
    modifier whenNotFrozen(address target) {
        require(!_frozen[target], "Freezable : target is frozen");
        _;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Allows the owner to freeze a specific address.
     * @dev Emits a Freeze event and sets the frozen status of the target address to true.
     * @param target The address to be frozen.
     * @return success Returns true if the operation was successful.
     */
    function freeze(address target) external onlyOwner returns (bool success) {
        _frozen[target] = true;
        emit Freeze(target);
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Allows the owner to unfreeze a specific address.
     * @dev Emits an Unfreeze event and sets the frozen status of the target address to false.
     * @param target The address to be unfrozen.
     * @return success Returns true if the operation was successful.
     */
    function unFreeze(address target)
        external
        onlyOwner
        returns (bool success)
    {
        _frozen[target] = false;
        emit Unfreeze(target);
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Checks if a specific address is frozen.
     * @dev Returns the frozen status of the target address.
     * @param target The address to check.
     * @return frozen Returns true if the address is frozen, otherwise false.
     */
    function isFrozen(address target)
        external
        view
        returns (bool frozen)
    {
        return _frozen[target];
    }
}
```

This implementation:
1. Completes the `freeze` function to set an address as frozen and emit the appropriate event
2. Completes the `unFreeze` function to unfreeze an address and emit the Unfreeze event
3. Completes the `isFrozen` function to check the frozen status of an address
4. Maintains the existing modifier that prevents actions on frozen addresses
5. Follows the contract's inheritance from Ownable, which restricts freeze/unfreeze operations to the owner

All functions return a success boolean as specified in the function signatures.
