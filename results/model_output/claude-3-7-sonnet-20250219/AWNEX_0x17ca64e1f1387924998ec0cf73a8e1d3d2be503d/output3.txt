Here's the completed `Freezable` smart contract according to your requirements:

```solidity
/**
 * @notice A smart contract that allows the owner to freeze and unfreeze specific addresses.
 * @dev This contract inherits from Ownable, allowing only the contract owner to perform freeze and unfreeze operations.
 */
contract Freezable is Ownable {
    mapping(address => bool) private _frozen;

    event Freeze(address indexed target);
    event Unfreeze(address indexed target);

    /**
     * @notice Modifier to ensure a function can only be executed if the target address is not frozen.
     * @dev Reverts with an error message if the target address is frozen.
     * @param target The address to check for the frozen status.
     */
    modifier whenNotFrozen(address target) {
        require(!_frozen[target], "Freezable : target is frozen");
        _;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Allows the owner to freeze a specific address.
     * @dev Emits a Freeze event and sets the frozen status of the target address to true.
     * @param target The address to be frozen.
     * @return success Returns true if the operation was successful.
     */
    function freeze(address target) external onlyOwner returns (bool success) {
        _frozen[target] = true;
        emit Freeze(target);
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Allows the owner to unfreeze a specific address.
     * @dev Emits an Unfreeze event and sets the frozen status of the target address to false.
     * @param target The address to be unfrozen.
     * @return success Returns true if the operation was successful.
     */
    function unFreeze(address target)
        external
        onlyOwner
        returns (bool success)
    {
        _frozen[target] = false;
        emit Unfreeze(target);
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Checks if a specific address is frozen.
     * @dev Returns the frozen status of the target address.
     * @param target The address to check.
     * @return frozen Returns true if the address is frozen, otherwise false.
     */
    function isFrozen(address target)
        external
        view
        returns (bool frozen)
    {
        return _frozen[target];
    }
}
```

The contract implements all the required functionality:
1. A mapping to track which addresses are frozen
2. Events for freezing and unfreezing addresses
3. A modifier to check if an address is frozen
4. Functions for freezing, unfreezing, and checking if an address is frozen
5. Only the owner can freeze or unfreeze addresses, enforced by inheriting from the Ownable contract
