I'll complete the `UpgradeabilityProxy` contract according to the provided context and description:

```solidity
/**
 * @notice This contract serves as an upgradeable proxy, allowing the logic implementation of a contract to be updated.
 * @dev The contract uses the EIP-1967 standard for storing the implementation address. It provides functions to set and upgrade the implementation.
 */
contract UpgradeabilityProxy is Proxy {

  /**
   * @notice Initializes the proxy with an initial implementation and optionally calls a function on the implementation.
   * @dev The constructor sets the initial implementation and, if provided, forwards the `_data` to the implementation.
   * @param _logic The address of the initial implementation.
   * @param _data Data to be passed to the initial implementation after it is set.
   */
  constructor(address _logic, bytes memory _data) public payable {
    assert(IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT == bytes32(uint256(keccak256('eip1967.proxy.implementation')) - 1));
    _setImplementation(_logic);
    if(_data.length > 0) {
      (bool success,) = _logic.delegatecall(_data);
      require(success);
    }
  }  

  /**
   * @notice Emitted when the implementation is upgraded.
   * @dev This event logs the new implementation address.
   * @param implementation The address of the new implementation.
   */
  event Upgraded(address indexed implementation);

  /**
   * @notice Internal constant for the storage slot used to store the implementation address.
   * @dev This slot is used in the EIP-1967 standard for storing the implementation address.
   */
  bytes32 internal constant IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;

  /**
   * @notice Returns the current implementation address.
   * @dev This function reads the implementation address from the storage slot.
   * @return impl The address of the current implementation.
   */
  function _implementation() internal override view returns (address impl) {
    bytes32 slot = IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT;
    assembly {
      impl := sload(slot)
    }
  }

  /**
   * @notice Upgrades the implementation to a new address.
   * @dev This function sets the new implementation and emits the `Upgraded` event.
   * @param newImplementation The address of the new implementation.
   */
  function _upgradeTo(address newImplementation) internal {
    _setImplementation(newImplementation);
    emit Upgraded(newImplementation);
  }

  /**
   * @notice Sets the implementation to a new address.
   * @dev This function ensures the new implementation is a contract and updates the storage slot.
   * @param newImplementation The address of the new implementation.
   */
  function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {
    require(Address.isContract(newImplementation), "Cannot set a non-contract as implementation");
    
    bytes32 slot = IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT;
    assembly {
      sstore(slot, newImplementation)
    }
  }

  /**
   * @notice Fallback function to receive Ether.
   * @dev This function allows the contract to receive Ether.
   */
  receive() external payable override {}
}
```

Note: I noticed that the `receive()` function was already defined in the base `Proxy` contract, so I added the `override` modifier to the implementation in `UpgradeabilityProxy`.
