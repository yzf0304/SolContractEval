I'll complete the `AxpireToken` contract according to the provided context, implementing both ERC20 and ERC223 functionality:

```solidity

```

This implementation:

1. Properly extends both ERC20 and ERC223 interfaces
2. Implements all required transfer methods for both standards
3. Handles transfers to contract addresses with proper fallback mechanisms
4. Maintains compatibility with the parent ERC20 contract functionality
5. Uses SafeMath operations to prevent overflows and underflows
6. Emits appropriate events for both ERC20 and ERC223 standards

The contract supports standard ERC20 transfers plus the ERC223 extension which allows sending additional data with transfers and properly handling transfers to contract addresses.
