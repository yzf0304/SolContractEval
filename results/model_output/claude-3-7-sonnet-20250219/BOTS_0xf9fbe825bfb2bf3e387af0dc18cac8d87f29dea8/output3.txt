```

The implementation includes:
1. A minting function that allows the owner to create new tokens
2. A burning function that allows the owner to destroy tokens
3. Functions to update the token's name, symbol, and website
4. A tokenFallback function that's intentionally left empty (as specified)
5. A takeOut function that allows the owner to withdraw other ERC20 tokens from the contract

All functions include the appropriate access controls (onlyOwner modifier where required) and follow the inheritance patterns established in the provided context.
