This implementation includes all required functionality:
1. Constructor initializing the token and unlocker addresses
2. Functions to add and remove CZR locks
3. A function to unlock CZR tokens based on the time passed since lock start
4. Functions to handle ETH (withdraw and receive via fallback)
5. Appropriate events for tracking lock additions, removals, and unlocks
6. Proper access control for sensitive functions

The unlock logic calculates the amount of tokens to be unlocked based on the proportion of the lock period that has passed, with tokens being released monthly. It ensures that only the contract owner or designated unlocker can trigger the unlock process.
