     *   - Only callable by contract owner or unlocker
     *   - User must have existing locked CZR records
     * @dev Behavior:
     *   - Calculates unlockable amount for each lock based on time passed
     *   - Processes up to 'limit' locks if specified
     *   - Transfers unlocked tokens to user's address
     *   - Emits Unlock event for each processed lock
     * @dev Notes:
     *   - Locks are processed in order (oldest first)
     *   - Monthly unlocking schedule is enforced
     *   - Requires sufficient token balance in contract
     * @dev Returns:
     *   - Number of locks processed (implicit via require check)
