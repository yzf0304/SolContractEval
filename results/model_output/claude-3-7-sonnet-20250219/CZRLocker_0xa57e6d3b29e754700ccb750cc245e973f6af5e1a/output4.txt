     *   - Calculates unlockable amount for each lock based on time passed

     *   - Transfers unlocked tokens to user's address
     *   - Emits Unlock event for each processed lock
     * @dev Notes:
     *   - Locks are processed in order (oldest first)
     *   - Monthly unlocking schedule is enforced
     *   - Requires sufficient token balance in contract
     * @dev Returns:
     *   - Number of locks processed (implicit via require check)
