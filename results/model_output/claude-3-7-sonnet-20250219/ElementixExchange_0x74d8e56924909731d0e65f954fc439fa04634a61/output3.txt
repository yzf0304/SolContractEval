I'll complete the ProxyRegistry smart contract with the required functions according to the description.

       a malicious but rational attacker could buy half the Elementix and grant themselves access to all the proxy contracts. A delay period renders this attack nonthreatening - given one weeks, if that happened, users would have

```

This implementation includes:

1. The `OwnableDelegateProxy` interface to define the expected interface of proxy contracts
2. A constructor to initialize the delegate proxy implementation
3. Implementation of `startGrantAuthentication` to begin the permission granting process with a timestamp
4. Implementation of `endGrantAuthentication` that verifies the delay period has passed
5. Implementation of `revokeAuthentication` for immediate permission removal
6. Implementation of `registerProxy` which creates a new proxy contract using low-level assembly

The contract properly emits events for proxy registration and authentication operations, and includes appropriate access controls and validation.
