This implementation follows all the requirements from the provided context, creating a fully functional ERC20 token with additional features like distribution control and foreign token withdrawal. The contract includes SafeMath operations to prevent overflow/underflow and implements all the standard ERC20 functions along with custom functionality specific to FaithCoin.
