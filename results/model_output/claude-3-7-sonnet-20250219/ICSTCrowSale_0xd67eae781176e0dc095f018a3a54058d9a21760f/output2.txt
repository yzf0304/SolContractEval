```

This implementation includes:

1. A constructor that initializes state variables and sets the token address
2. A fallback function that handles incoming ether during the crowdsale period
3. Owner functions to:
   - Withdraw tokens from the contract
   - Perform airdrops to multiple addresses
   - Withdraw ether from the contract
   - Initialize the crowdsale parameters
   - Change the token address

4. An internal function to process funding and token transfers

The contract uses SafeMath for all arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and underflows, and inherits from Ownable for access control.
