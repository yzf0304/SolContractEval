I'll complete the `Bonus` contract according to the provided context. Note that in Solidity 0.4.18, the `receive()` function wasn't available, so I'll replace it with the appropriate fallback function for that version.

This implementation includes all the required functions with appropriate logic:

1. Constructor sets `isBonus` to true initially
2. Functions to enable/disable bonuses with proper checks
3. Bonus calculation based on time (ICO phase)
4. Additional bonus calculation based on ETH amount
5. Function to check bonus balance
6. Function to pay bonuses to addresses
7. Fallback function to receive ETH
8. Added a helper function to add bonuses to accounts

The implementation follows the SafeMath pattern for arithmetic operations and inherits from IcoPhase and Ownable as specified.
