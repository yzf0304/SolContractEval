 * @dev This contract includes a referral system, daily ROI, and tax mechanisms for staking and unstaking. It also allows the owner to manage certain parameters.

This implementation includes all the required functionality for the LeadStake contract:
- Registration and staking with referral system
- Staking with tax calculation
- Unstaking with tax calculation
- Earnings calculation based on daily ROI
- Withdrawal of accumulated rewards
- Admin functions to manage contract parameters
- Pause/unpause functionality for contract operations
- Owner's ability to withdraw from the reward pool

The contract handles all the necessary state tracking, tax calculations, and event emissions as specified in the requirements.
