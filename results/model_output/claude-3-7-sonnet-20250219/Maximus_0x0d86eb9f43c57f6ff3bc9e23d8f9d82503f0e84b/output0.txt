```

This implementation includes:
1. Basic ERC20 functionality for transfers and approvals
2. Staking functionality allowing users to stake tokens for a specified period
3. The ability to end stakes once the staking period is complete
4. Functions to query the current day and stake count
5. Proper event emissions for all state-changing operations
6. Standard balance and allowance checking

The contract handles the core functionality described in the requirements while maintaining appropriate security checks throughout.
