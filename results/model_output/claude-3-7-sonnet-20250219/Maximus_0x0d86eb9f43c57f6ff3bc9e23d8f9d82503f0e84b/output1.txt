I'll complete the HEXToken contract based on the provided context and function signatures. Since this is a partial implementation focused on staking, transferring, and approval functionality, I'll implement these core functions:

This implementation provides the core functionality for the HEXToken contract, including:

1. Staking and unstaking HEX tokens
2. Transferring HEX tokens between addresses
3. Approving and transferring HEX tokens on behalf of others
4. Tracking stake information and current day calculations

The contract maintains the state of user balances, allowances, and stakes. It emits appropriate events for transfers, approvals, stake starts, and stake ends to allow for external tracking of these actions.
