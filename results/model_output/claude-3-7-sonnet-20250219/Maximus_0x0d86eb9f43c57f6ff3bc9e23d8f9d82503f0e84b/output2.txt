This implementation includes:

1. Basic token functionality (balances, allowances, transfers)
2. Staking mechanisms to lock tokens for specified periods
3. The ability to end stakes after their duration
4. Tracking of active stakes per address
5. Day calculation based on contract launch time
6. Proper events for all important actions

The contract enforces appropriate checks for stake durations, balances, and stake validity when performing operations.
