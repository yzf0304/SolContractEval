I'll complete the HEXToken contract based on your requirements. The implementation will focus on staking, transfers, and approvals for the HEX token system.

```

This implementation includes:

1. Core staking functionality with `stakeStart` and `stakeEnd`
2. Standard ERC20 transfer and approval functions
3. A tracking system for active stakes
4. A method to get the current day since contract launch
5. A function to count active stakes for a given address

Note that in a production environment, this contract would need more robust security features, especially around staking rewards calculation and stake verification.
