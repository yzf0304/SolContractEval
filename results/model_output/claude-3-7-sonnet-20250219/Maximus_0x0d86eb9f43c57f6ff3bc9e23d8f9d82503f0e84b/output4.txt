I'll complete the HEXToken contract based on the provided context. Here's the implementation:

```

This implementation includes:

1. State variables for tracking balances, allowances, and stakes
2. A struct for representing stakes with necessary properties
3. Implementation of all required functions according to the specifications
4. Events to emit on important state changes
5. Proper validation checks for all functions
6. Active stake counting functionality that only counts active stakes

Note that the contract handles basic token functionality (transfer, approve) as well as staking functionality (stakeStart, stakeEnd, stakeCount), and provides a way to check the current day in the contract context.
