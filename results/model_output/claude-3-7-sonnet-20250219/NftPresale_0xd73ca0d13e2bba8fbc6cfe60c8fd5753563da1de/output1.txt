This implementation follows all the requirements specified in the context:
1. Users can only buy 1 NFT during the presale period
2. The presale has specific start and end times
3. The price is fixed at 0.2 ETH
4. Purchases require a valid signature from the verification address
5. Each buyer can only purchase once
6. The contract owner can withdraw funds
7. The contract implements all required functions with appropriate validation
