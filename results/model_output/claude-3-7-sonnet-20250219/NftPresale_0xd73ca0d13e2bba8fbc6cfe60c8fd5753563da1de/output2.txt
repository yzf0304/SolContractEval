This contract implements all the required functionality for the NFT presale, including:

1. Time-bound purchasing window (START_TIME to FINISH_TIME)
2. Fixed price of 0.2 ETH per NFT
3. Signature verification to ensure only authorized purchases
4. Prevention of multiple purchases by the same address
5. Owner-only cashout function to withdraw funds
6. Proper handling of ETH transfers to the receiver address

The signature verification process ensures that only addresses that have been pre-approved (through an off-chain signing process using the verifyAddress account) can participate in the presale.
