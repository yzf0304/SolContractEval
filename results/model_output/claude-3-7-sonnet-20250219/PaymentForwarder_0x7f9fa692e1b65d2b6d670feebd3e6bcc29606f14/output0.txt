```

This implementation includes:
1. Tracking of payments by customer ID and benefactor address
2. Incrementing customer count for new customers
3. Forwarding funds to the team multisig wallet
4. Checksum verification for secure payments
5. Multiple payment methods for flexibility
6. Emergency stop functionality (inherited from Haltable)
7. Proper event emission to track payments

The contract is compatible with Solidity 0.4.18 and follows the provided structure and requirements.
