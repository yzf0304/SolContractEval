I'll complete the `PaymentForwarder` contract based on the provided context. Since this is using Solidity 0.4.18, I'll implement the functions accordingly:

```solidity
/**
 * @title PaymentForwarder
 * @notice A contract to forward payments to a team multisig address, tracking the total amount transferred, number of customers, and individual customer and benefactor contributions.
 * @dev This contract inherits from Haltable, allowing for emergency stops. It records payments and forwards them to a specified team multisig address.
 */
contract PaymentForwarder is Haltable {

  /** Who will get all ETH in the end */
  address public teamMultisig;

  /** Total incoming money */
  uint public totalTransferred;

  /** How many distinct customers we have that have made a payment */
  uint public customerCount;

  /** Total incoming money per centrally tracked customer id */
  mapping(uint128 => uint) public paymentsByCustomer;

  /** Total incoming money per benefactor address */
  mapping(address => uint) public paymentsByBenefactor;

  /** A customer has made a payment. Benefactor is the address where the tokens will be ultimately issued. */
  event PaymentForwarded(address source, uint amount, uint128 customerId, address benefactor);

  /**
   * @notice Initializes the contract with the owner and team multisig addresses.
   * @dev Sets the `teamMultisig` and `owner` addresses.
   * @param _owner The address of the contract owner.
   * @param _teamMultisig The address of the team multisig wallet.
   */
  function PaymentForwarder(address _owner, address _teamMultisig) {
    teamMultisig = _teamMultisig;
    owner = _owner;
  }

  /**
   * @notice Allows a customer to make a payment without a checksum.
   * @dev Records the payment, updates the total transferred, and forwards the payment to the team multisig address.
   * @param customerId The unique identifier for the customer.
   * @param benefactor The address that will benefit from the payment.
   */
  function payWithoutChecksum(uint128 customerId, address benefactor) public stopInEmergency payable {
    address source = msg.sender;
    uint amount = msg.value;

    // Record the payment
    if(paymentsByCustomer[customerId] == 0) {
      customerCount++;
    }
    
    paymentsByCustomer[customerId] += amount;
    paymentsByBenefactor[benefactor] += amount;
    totalTransferred += amount;

    // Forward the payment to the team multisig
    if(!teamMultisig.send(amount)) {
      throw;
    }

    // Emit event
    PaymentForwarded(source, amount, customerId, benefactor);
  }

  /**
   * @notice Allows a customer to make a payment on behalf of an address with a checksum.
   * @dev Verifies the checksum and then calls `payWithoutChecksum` to process the payment.
   * @param customerId The unique identifier for the customer.
   * @param benefactor The address that will benefit from the payment.
   * @param checksum The checksum to verify the payment.
   */
  function pay(uint128 customerId, address benefactor, bytes1 checksum) public stopInEmergency payable {
    // Calculate the expected checksum
    bytes1 calculatedChecksum = bytes1(uint8(customerId & 0xff) ^ uint8(customerId >> 8) ^ uint8(customerId >> 16) ^ uint8(customerId >> 24) ^ uint8(uint256(benefactor) & 0xff));
    
    // Verify the checksum
    if(checksum != calculatedChecksum) {
      throw;
    }
    
    // Process the payment
    payWithoutChecksum(customerId, benefactor);
  }

  /**
   * @notice Allows a customer to make a payment on their own behalf with a checksum.
   * @dev Verifies the checksum and then calls `payWithoutChecksum` to process the payment.
   * @param customerId The unique identifier for the customer.
   * @param checksum The checksum to verify the payment.
   */
  function payForMyselfWithChecksum(uint128 customerId, bytes1 checksum) public payable {
    pay(customerId, msg.sender, checksum);
  }

  /**
   * @notice Allows a customer to make a payment on their own behalf without a checksum.
   * @dev Calls `payWithoutChecksum` to process the payment.
   * @param customerId The unique identifier for the customer.
   */
  function payForMyself(uint128 customerId) public payable {
    payWithoutChecksum(customerId, msg.sender);
  }

  /**
   * @notice Fallback function to receive Ether.
   * @dev Reverts if the contract receives Ether directly.
   */
  function() public payable {
    throw;
  }
}
```

Note: In Solidity 0.4.18, there was no `receive()` function. Instead, we use a fallback function `function()` to handle direct Ether transfers to the contract. Also, at that time, `revert()` wasn't commonly used - `throw` was the standard way to revert transactions.
