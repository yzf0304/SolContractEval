Here's the completed `PaymentForwarder` contract that fulfills the requirements based on the provided context:

```

Note: I've implemented the contract according to Solidity 0.4.18 standards, using `throw` instead of `revert()` for error handling and following the inheritance pattern from the Haltable contract. The checksum implementation is a simple XOR of the bytes in the customerId as a security measure. The contract tracks payments by customer ID and benefactor address, forwards all payments to the team multisig address, and emits an event for each payment.
