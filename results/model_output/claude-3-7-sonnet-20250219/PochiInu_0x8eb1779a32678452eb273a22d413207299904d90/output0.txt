This contract implementation includes all the functionality described in the context, including:

1. Trading limits for buys, sells, and wallet size
2. Fee structure for buys and sells with distribution to operations, liquidity, and Yasha wallets
3. Anti-bot and anti-whale mechanisms
4. Automated market maker pair management
5. Liquidity management through swapping tokens for ETH
6. Owner controls for all key parameters

The contract follows best practices for security and gas optimization while maintaining the required functionality.
