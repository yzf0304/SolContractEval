This contract implements all the required functionality according to the specifications:

1. ERC20 token with configurable fees for buy and sell transactions
2. Anti-bot and anti-whale mechanisms including transfer delay and maximum transaction limits
3. Liquidity management through automatic swaps and adds
4. Fee distribution to operations and Yasha wallets
5. Owner control functions for updating parameters and excluding addresses from fees
6. Trading can be enabled and limits can be removed when the token is stable

The implementation follows best practices for security and gas efficiency while maintaining all the specified functionality.
