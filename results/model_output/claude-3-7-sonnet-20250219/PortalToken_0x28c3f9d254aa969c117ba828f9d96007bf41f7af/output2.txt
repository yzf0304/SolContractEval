```

This implementation provides all the required functionality for the PortalToken contract:
- ERC20 standard functions: `balanceOf`, `totalSupply`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `allowance`
- Additional features: `jailAmountOf`, `enableTransfers`, `catchYou`
- An internal `doTransfer` function to handle the actual token transfers
- A fallback function to receive Ether

The contract allows for:
1. Token transfers between accounts
2. Approving other accounts to spend tokens
3. Jailing accounts to prevent them from transferring tokens
4. Enabling/disabling all token transfers
5. Tracking jail amounts for accounts
