This implementation includes all the required functionality for the `SaudiPotatoz` NFT contract:

1. Free and paid minting options with appropriate checks
2. Owner-only management functions for contract settings
3. Withdrawal functionality for collected ETH
4. Support for explicit ownership setting to optimize gas usage
5. Various helper functions for contract interaction
6. Security features including reentrancy guards and access control

The contract is built on the ERC721A standard for efficient batch minting and includes all the necessary modifiers to ensure secure operation.
