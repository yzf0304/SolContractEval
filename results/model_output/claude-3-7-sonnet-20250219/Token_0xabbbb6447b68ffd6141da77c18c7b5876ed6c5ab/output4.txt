I'll complete the Token contract by implementing all the required functions according to the provided context and descriptions:

The implementation follows ERC20 standards while incorporating the pausable functionality. The contract includes all required methods with appropriate validations and follows the SafeMath library for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and underflows.
