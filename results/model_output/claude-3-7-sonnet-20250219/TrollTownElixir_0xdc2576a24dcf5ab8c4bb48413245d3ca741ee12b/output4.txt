This implementation follows the ERC1155 standard, providing functionality for managing both fungible and non-fungible tokens. The contract includes all the required functions for transferring tokens, approving operators, and querying balances, as well as internal functions for minting and burning tokens. It also includes hooks for customizing behavior before token transfers.
