Here's the completed `Pausable` contract according to the provided context and description:

```solidity
/**
 * @title Pausable
 * @dev This contract allows the owner to pause and unpause all functions that use the `whenNotPaused` modifier.
 * @notice The pauser, initially set by the contract owner, can change the paused state of the contract. 
 * Only the owner can change the pauser role.
 */
contract Pausable is Context, Ownable {
    
    event Pause();
    event Unpause();
    event PauserChanged(address indexed newAddress);

    address public pauser;
    bool public paused = false;

    /**
     * @dev Modifier to make a function callable only when the contract is not paused.
     * @notice Functions with this modifier will revert if the contract is paused.
     */
    modifier whenNotPaused() {
        require(!paused, "Network paused by administrator");
        _;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Modifier to restrict access to the pauser.
     * @notice Only the account with the pauser role can call functions with this modifier.
     */
    modifier onlyPauser() {
        require(msg.sender == pauser, "Caller is not the pause administrator");
        _;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Constructor that sets the deployer as the initial pauser.
     */
    constructor() {
        pauser = _msgSender();
        emit PauserChanged(_msgSender());
    }

    /**
     * @dev Allows the pauser to pause the contract, preventing any further actions until it is unpaused.
     * @notice Emits a {Pause} event.
     */
    function pause() external onlyPauser {
        paused = true;
        emit Pause();
    }

    /**
     * @dev Allows the pauser to unpause the contract, allowing normal operations to resume.
     * @notice Emits an {Unpause} event.
     */
    function unpause() external onlyPauser {
        paused = false;
        emit Unpause();
    }

    /**
     * @dev Allows the owner to update the pauser role.
     * @notice Reverts if the new pauser is the zero address. Emits a {PauserChanged} event.
     */
    function updatePauser(address _newPauser) external onlyOwner {
        require(_newPauser != address(0), "New pauser is the zero address");
        pauser = _newPauser;
        emit PauserChanged(_newPauser);
    }
}
```

I've completed the implementation by:
1. Adding a constructor that sets the deployer as the initial pauser
2. Implementing the `pause()` function to set the paused state to true and emit the Pause event
3. Implementing the `unpause()` function to set the paused state to false and emit the Unpause event
4. Implementing the `updatePauser()` function to change the pauser role with a check for the zero address

The contract follows all the specified requirements and maintains the functionality described in the comments.
