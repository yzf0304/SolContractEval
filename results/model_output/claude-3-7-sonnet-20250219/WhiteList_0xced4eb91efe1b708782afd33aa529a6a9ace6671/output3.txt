The contract code is incomplete and has some issues for Solidity 0.4.18. Let me provide the corrected version of the WhiteList contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

/**
 * @title WhiteList
 * @notice A contract for managing a whitelist of addresses. Only the owner can add or remove addresses from the whitelist.
 * @dev Inherits from Ownable to restrict certain functions to the contract owner.
 */
contract WhiteList is Ownable {

    // @notice Mapping to store the whitelist status of an address.
    // @dev The key is the address, and the value is a boolean indicating whether the address is whitelisted.
    mapping(address => bool) public whiteList;

    // @notice Total number of whitelisted addresses.
    // @dev This count is updated when addresses are added or removed from the whitelist.
    uint public totalWhiteListed; //white listed users number

    // @dev Event emitted when an address is whitelisted.
    event LogWhiteListed(address indexed user, uint whiteListedNum);

    // @dev Event emitted when multiple addresses are whitelisted.
    event LogWhiteListedMultiple(uint whiteListedNum);

    // @dev Event emitted when an address is removed from the whitelist.
    event LogRemoveWhiteListed(address indexed user);

    /**
     * @notice Checks if a given address is whitelisted.
     * @param _user The address to check.
     * @return true if the address is whitelisted, false otherwise.
     */
    function isWhiteListed(address _user) external view returns (bool) {
        return whiteList[_user]; 
    }

    /**
     * @notice Removes an address from the whitelist.
     * @dev Only the contract owner can call this function.
     * @param _user The address to remove from the whitelist.
     * @return true if the address was successfully removed.
     */
    function removeFromWhiteList(address _user) external onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        require(whiteList[_user] == true);
        whiteList[_user] = false;
        totalWhiteListed--;
        LogRemoveWhiteListed(_user);
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Adds an address to the whitelist.
     * @dev Only the contract owner can call this function.
     * @param _user The address to add to the whitelist.
     * @return true if the address was successfully added.
     */
    function addToWhiteList(address _user) external onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        if (whiteList[_user] != true) {
            whiteList[_user] = true;
            totalWhiteListed++;
            LogWhiteListed(_user, totalWhiteListed);            
        }
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Adds multiple addresses to the whitelist.
     * @dev Only the contract owner can call this function.
     * @param _users An array of addresses to add to the whitelist.
     * @return true if all addresses were successfully added.
     */
    function addToWhiteListMultiple(address[] _users) external onlyOwner returns (bool) {
        for (uint i = 0; i < _users.length; i++) {
            if (whiteList[_users[i]] != true) {
                whiteList[_users[i]] = true;
                totalWhiteListed++;                          
            }           
        }
        LogWhiteListedMultiple(totalWhiteListed); 
        return true;
    }
}
```

Key changes made to ensure compatibility with Solidity 0.4.18:

1. Removed the `calldata` keyword from the `addToWhiteListMultiple` function parameter (not available in 0.4.18)
2. Changed `++i` to `i++` in the for loop for better compatibility
3. Replaced `emit` keyword with direct event invocation (in 0.4.18, the `emit` keyword was not yet introduced)
4. Ensured function visibility modifiers are in the right position
5. Added the pragma directive to specify the compiler version

The contract is now properly formatted and compatible with Solidity 0.4.18.
