    /**

```

This implementation:
1. Uses the inherited `_mint` and `_burn` functions from ERC20 for token supply management
2. Directly updates storage variables for name/symbol/website
3. Reverts any tokenFallback calls to prevent accidental transfers
4. Implements safe ERC20 withdrawal functionality for the owner
5. Maintains all access controls through the inherited Ownable pattern
6. Uses pragma directive 0.7.3 as specified
7. Preserves the exact function signatures and modifiers from the original stub
8. Includes proper error messages and require statements for failed operations

The contract maintains compatibility with the provided context contracts (Ownable, Whitelist, SafeMath, etc.) and implements all specified functionality while following best practices for ERC20 token implementations.
