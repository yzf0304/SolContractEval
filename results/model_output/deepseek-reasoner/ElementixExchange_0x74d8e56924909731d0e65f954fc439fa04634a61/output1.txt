Here's the complete implementation of the ProxyRegistry contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.4;

contract ProxyRegistry is Ownable {
    address public delegateProxyImplementation;
    mapping(address => OwnableDelegateProxy) public proxies;
    mapping(address => uint256) public pending;
    mapping(address => bool) public contracts;
    uint256 public DELAY_PERIOD = 7 days;

    event RegisterProxy(address indexed sender, address proxyAddr);
    event AuthenticationOperation(address indexed addr, bool opt);

    function startGrantAuthentication(address addr) public onlyOwner {
        pending[addr] = block.timestamp + DELAY_PERIOD;
    }

    function endGrantAuthentication(address addr) public onlyOwner {
        require(pending[addr] != 0, "Addr not pending");
        require(block.timestamp >= pending[addr], "Delay period not passed");
        contracts[addr] = true;
        delete pending[addr];
        emit AuthenticationOperation(addr, true);
    }

    function revokeAuthentication(address addr) public onlyOwner {
        contracts[addr] = false;
        emit AuthenticationOperation(addr, false);
    }

    function registerProxy() public returns (OwnableDelegateProxy proxy) {
        require(address(proxies[msg.sender]) == address(0), "Proxy already exists");
        proxy = new OwnableDelegateProxy(msg.sender, delegateProxyImplementation);
        proxies[msg.sender] = proxy;
        emit RegisterProxy(msg.sender, address(proxy));
        return proxy;
    }
}

contract OwnableDelegateProxy {}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **startGrantAuthentication:**
   - Sets the pending period for an address by storing the current timestamp plus the DELAY_PERIOD.

2. **endGrantAuthentication:**
   - Checks if the address has a pending grant and if the delay period has expired.
   - Grants authentication by setting `contracts[addr]` to true and clears the pending status.

3. **revokeAuthentication:**
   - Immediately revokes authentication by setting `contracts[addr]` to false.

4. **registerProxy:**
   - Ensures the user doesn't already have a proxy.
   - Creates a new OwnableDelegateProxy instance with the user as owner and the stored implementation.
   - Stores the new proxy and emits an event.

The OwnableDelegateProxy contract is declared as an empty contract to satisfy the interface requirements from the proxies mapping. In a real implementation, this would contain proxy logic using the delegateProxyImplementation.
