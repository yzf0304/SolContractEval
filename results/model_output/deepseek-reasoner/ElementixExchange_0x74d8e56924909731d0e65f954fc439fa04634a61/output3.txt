Here is the completed `ProxyRegistry` contract:

```solidity
contract ProxyRegistry is Ownable {
    address public delegateProxyImplementation;
    mapping(address => OwnableDelegateProxy) public proxies;
    mapping(address => uint256) public pending;
    mapping(address => bool) public contracts;
    uint256 public DELAY_PERIOD = 7 days;

    event RegisterProxy(address indexed sender, address proxyAddr);
    event AuthenticationOperation(address indexed addr, bool opt);

    constructor(address _delegateProxyImplementation) Ownable() {
        delegateProxyImplementation = _delegateProxyImplementation;
    }

    function startGrantAuthentication(address addr) public onlyOwner {
        require(!contracts[addr], "Already authenticated");
        pending[addr] = block.timestamp;
    }

    function endGrantAuthentication(address addr) public onlyOwner {
        require(pending[addr] != 0, "Not pending");
        require(block.timestamp >= pending[addr] + DELAY_PERIOD, "Delay ongoing");
        contracts[addr] = true;
        delete pending[addr];
        emit AuthenticationOperation(addr, true);
    }

    function revokeAuthentication(address addr) public onlyOwner {
        require(contracts[addr], "Not authenticated");
        contracts[addr] = false;
        emit AuthenticationOperation(addr, false);
    }

    function registerProxy() public returns (OwnableDelegateProxy proxy) {
        require(address(proxies[msg.sender]) == address(0), "Proxy exists");
        proxy = new OwnableDelegateProxy(msg.sender, delegateProxyImplementation);
        proxies[msg.sender] = proxy;
        emit RegisterProxy(msg.sender, address(proxy));
        return proxy;
    }
}
```

**Key Implementation Details:**

1. **Constructor:** Initializes the `delegateProxyImplementation` address during deployment, which is crucial for proxy creation.

2. **Access Control Functions:**
   - `startGrantAuthentication`: Initiates the authentication process by setting a timestamp for the address.
   - `endGrantAuthentication`: Completes authentication after the delay period, updating the `contracts` mapping.
   - `revokeAuthentication`: Immediately revokes access, demonstrating different security timings for granting vs revoking.

3. **Proxy Management:**
   - `registerProxy`: Allows users to deploy their own proxy contract using the predefined implementation. Ensures each user has only one proxy.

4. **Security Considerations:**
   - Strict access control using `onlyOwner` modifier.
   - Delay period enforcement to prevent instant authorization changes.
   - State management with mappings to track pending/authorized contracts and user proxies.

The contract maintains security while enabling flexible proxy management, following OpenZeppelin best practices for access control and state management.
