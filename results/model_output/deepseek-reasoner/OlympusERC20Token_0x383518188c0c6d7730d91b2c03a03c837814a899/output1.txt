Here is the completed code for the OlympusERC20Token contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity 0.7.5;

contract OlympusERC20Token is Divine {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    constructor() Divine("Olympus", "OHM", 9) {}

    function mint(address account_, uint256 amount_) external onlyVault() {
        _mint(account_, amount_);
    }

    function burn(uint256 amount) public virtual override {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function burnFrom(address account_, uint256 amount_) public virtual override {
        uint256 decreasedAllowance = allowance(account_, msg.sender).sub(
            amount_,
            "ERC20: burn amount exceeds allowance"
        );
        _approve(account_, msg.sender, decreasedAllowance);
        _burn(account_, amount_);
    }
}
```

This implementation:
- Inherits from the Divine contract with proper token parameters
- Uses SafeMath for secure arithmetic operations
- Implements minting with vault-only access
- Provides token burning functionality for both direct burns and approved burns
- Maintains ERC20 compliance while adding custom functionality
- Uses compiler version 0.7.5 as specified
- Includes proper access control and error handling

The contract maintains all required functionality while strictly adhering to the provided specifications and context.
