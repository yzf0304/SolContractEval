Here is the complete and functional implementation of the OlympusERC20Token contract based on the provided context and requirements:

```solidity
contract OlympusERC20Token is Divine {

  using SafeMath for uint256;

    constructor() Divine("Olympus", "OHM", 9) {}

    function mint(address account_, uint256 amount_) external onlyVault() {
        _mint(account_, amount_);
    }

    function burn(uint256 amount) public virtual override {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function burnFrom(address account_, uint256 amount_) public virtual override {
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(account_, msg.sender);
        require(currentAllowance >= amount_, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds allowance");
        _approve(account_, msg.sender, currentAllowance.sub(amount_));
        _burn(account_, amount_);
    }

    function _burnFrom(address account_, uint256 amount_) internal virtual {
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(account_, msg.sender);
        require(currentAllowance >= amount_, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds allowance");
        _approve(account_, msg.sender, currentAllowance.sub(amount_));
        _burn(account_, amount_);
    }
}
```

This implementation:

1. **Minting**: Uses the ERC20's internal `_mint` function with vault-only access
2. **Burning**: Implements both direct burning and allowance-based burning
3. **Access Control**: Maintains vault-only access for minting operations
4. **Compliance**: Maintains ERC20 standards for allowances and transfer validation
5. **Safety**: Uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows/underflows

The contract maintains the TWAP oracle update functionality inherited from the Divine base contract while implementing the core ERC20 token requirements with proper access controls and safety checks.
