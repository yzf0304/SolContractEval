Here is the complete implementation of the OlympusERC20Token contract based on the provided context and requirements:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
pragma solidity 0.7.5;

contract OlympusERC20Token is Divine {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    constructor() Divine("Olympus", "OHM", 9) {}

    function mint(address account_, uint256 amount_) external onlyVault() {
        _mint(account_, amount_);
    }

    function burn(uint256 amount) public virtual {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function burnFrom(address account_, uint256 amount_) public virtual {
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(account_, msg.sender);
        require(currentAllowance >= amount_, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds allowance");
        _approve(account_, msg.sender, currentAllowance.sub(amount_));
        _burn(account_, amount_);
    }

    function _burnFrom(address account_, uint256 amount_) public virtual {
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(account_, msg.sender);
        require(currentAllowance >= amount_, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds allowance");
        _approve(account_, msg.sender, currentAllowance.sub(amount_));
        _burn(account_, amount_);
    }
}
```

This implementation:
1. Uses the SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations
2. Implements minting functionality callable only by the vault
3. Provides two burning mechanisms (direct burn and allowance-based burn)
4. Maintains compatibility with the TWAPOracleUpdater functionality inherited from Divine
5. Adheres to the ERC20 standard while adding custom burning features
6. Maintains the exact visibility and function signatures specified in the problem statement
7. Uses compiler version 0.7.5 as specified

The contract implements all required functionality while strictly following the provided code structure and comments.
