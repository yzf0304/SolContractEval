Key implementation details:
1. Uses `throw` for error handling (appropriate for Solidity 0.4.18)
2. Implements basic ERC20 functionality with balance checks
3. Maintains allowances for approved transfers
4. Includes proper event emissions for transfers and approvals
5. Maintains backward compatibility with Solidity 0.4.18 syntax
6. Prevents zero-value transfers
7. Maintains strict visibility for all functions and variables
8. Includes the required fallback function to prevent ETH transfers
