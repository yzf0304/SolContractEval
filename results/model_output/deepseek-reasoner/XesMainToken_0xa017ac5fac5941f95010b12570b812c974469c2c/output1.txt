To complete the `StandardToken` contract, we need to ensure it is fully functional as an ERC20 token with SafeMath integration. The key addition is a constructor to initialize the total supply and allocate the initial tokens to the deployer's address. This makes the contract functional by setting up the initial token distribution.

```solidity
contract StandardToken is ERC20, SafeMath {
    mapping (address => uint) balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) allowed;

    /**
     * @dev Constructor initializes the token's total supply and assigns all tokens to the deployer's address.
     * @param _initialSupply The initial token supply to be minted.
     */
    function StandardToken(uint _initialSupply) public {
        totalSupply = _initialSupply;
        balances[msg.sender] = _initialSupply;
    }

    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool success) {
        balances[msg.sender] = safeSub(balances[msg.sender], _value);
        balances[_to] = safeAdd(balances[_to], _value);
        Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool success) {
        uint _allowance = allowed[_from][msg.sender];
        allowed[_from][msg.sender] = safeSub(_allowance, _value);
        balances[_from] = safeSub(balances[_from], _value);
        balances[_to] = safeAdd(balances[_to], _value);
        Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }

    function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint balance) {
        return balances[_owner];
    }

    function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public returns (bool success) {
        allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
        return true;
    }

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public constant returns (uint remaining) {
        return allowed[_owner][_spender];
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Constructor Addition:** The constructor initializes the `totalSupply` with `_initialSupply` and assigns the entire supply to the deployer's address. This ensures tokens exist and are allocated upon deployment.
- **TransferFrom Adjustment:** The `transferFrom` function was corrected to first update the allowance before modifying balances. This prevents potential issues by ensuring the allowance check occurs before balance changes, adhering to common ERC20 patterns while maintaining safety through SafeMath.
