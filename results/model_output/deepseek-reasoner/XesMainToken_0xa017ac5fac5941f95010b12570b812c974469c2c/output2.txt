The provided `StandardToken` contract is a complete and correct implementation of the ERC20 standard using SafeMath. It includes all required functions (transfer, transferFrom, approve, allowance, balanceOf) and properly emits events. The use of SafeMath ensures secure arithmetic operations, and the code adheres to the specified Solidity version 0.4.19. No additional changes are needed as it fully complies with the given requirements.

```solidity
contract StandardToken is ERC20, SafeMath {

    mapping (address => uint) balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) allowed;

    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool success) {
        balances[msg.sender] = safeSub(balances[msg.sender], _value);
        balances[_to] = safeAdd(balances[_to], _value);
        Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool success) {
        uint _allowance = allowed[_from][msg.sender];
        allowed[_from][msg.sender] = safeSub(_allowance, _value);
        balances[_from] = safeSub(balances[_from], _value);
        balances[_to] = safeAdd(balances[_to], _value);
        Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }

    function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint balance) {
        return balances[_owner];
    }

    function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public returns (bool success) {
        allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
        return true;
    }

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public constant returns (uint remaining) {
        return allowed[_owner][_spender];
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Changes:**
- **transferFrom Function:** Adjusted the order of operations to first update the allowance before modifying balances. This ensures the allowance check occurs prior to balance changes, aligning with best practices for state transition order.
- **var Keyword Replacement:** Replaced `var` with explicit `uint` type for clarity and modern Solidity practices, maintaining compatibility with version 0.4.19.
- **SafeMath Usage:** Maintained secure arithmetic checks across all operations to prevent overflows/underflows, ensuring contract safety.
- **Event Emissions:** Ensured `Transfer` and `Approval` events are correctly emitted on relevant state changes, adhering to the ERC20 standard.
