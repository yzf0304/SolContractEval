I see you have provided the context and description for the `UpgradeabilityProxy` smart contract. To complete the contract, you need to implement the internal functions `_implementation`, `_upgradeTo`, and `_setImplementation` as per the provided context. Here is how you can implement these functions:

```solidity
contract UpgradeabilityProxy is Proxy {

  function _implementation() internal override view returns (address impl) {
    assembly {
      impl := sload(IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT)
    }
  }

  function _upgradeTo(address newImplementation) internal {
    _setImplementation(newImplementation);
    emit Upgraded(newImplementation);
  }

  function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {
    require(Address.isContract(newImplementation), "Cannot set implementation to a non-contract address");
    assembly {
      sstore(IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT, newImplementation)
    }
  }
}
```

These implementations ensure that the contract can retrieve the current implementation address, upgrade to a new implementation, and set a new implementation address. Let me know if you need further assistance with this contract.
