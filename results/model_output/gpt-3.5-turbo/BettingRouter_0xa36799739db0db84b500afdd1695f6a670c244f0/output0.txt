To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code snippets:

1. The `Context` contract provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data. It is used for intermediate, library-like contracts.

2. The `Ownable` contract provides a basic access control mechanism where there is an owner who has exclusive access to specific functions. The owner can transfer ownership to another account and has modifiers like `onlyOwner` and `doubleChecker`.

3. The `SafeMath` library contains functions for safe mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication of unsigned integers. Additionally, it includes functions for depositing ETH and ERC20 tokens, withdrawing tokens, locking tokens as collateral, unlocking tokens, and withdrawing specified tokens from contract pools.

4. The `SafeMath` library also includes functions for calculating the total leverage pool balance of a user in ETH, calculating token amounts to be used as collateral based on player's balances, and other utility functions related to managing token balances and collateral.
