To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code:

1. The `Context` contract provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data. It is used for intermediate, library-like contracts.

2. The `Ownable` contract is a contract module that provides a basic access control mechanism where there is an owner who has exclusive access to specific functions. The owner can transfer ownership to another account and has access to functions like `depositEth`, `depositErc20`, `withdraw`, `lock`, `unlock`, `withdrawFromContract`, `getPlayerLPBalanceInEth`, and `calcLockTokenAmountsAsCollateral`.

3. The `SafeMath` library contains functions for safe mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication of unsigned integers with overflow checks.

If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any part of the code, feel free to ask!
