To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code snippets:

1. The `Context` contract provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data. It is used for intermediate, library-like contracts.

2. The `Ownable` contract provides a basic access control mechanism where there is an owner who has exclusive access to specific functions. The owner can transfer ownership to another account and has modifiers like `onlyOwner` and `doubleChecker`.

3. The `SafeMath` library contains functions for safe mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication of unsigned integers. Additionally, it includes functions for depositing and withdrawing ETH and ERC20 tokens, locking and unlocking tokens as collateral, and calculating token amounts to be used as collateral based on player balances.

If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any part of the code, feel free to ask!
