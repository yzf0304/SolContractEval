I see you've provided the context and description for a Solidity smart contract named `Collection`. It interacts with a TRB token contract for staking, withdrawing, and submitting mining solutions. The contract inherits from `Ownable` to restrict certain functions to the owner only. It also ensures that only the original creator can call these functions.

If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with this contract, feel free to ask!
