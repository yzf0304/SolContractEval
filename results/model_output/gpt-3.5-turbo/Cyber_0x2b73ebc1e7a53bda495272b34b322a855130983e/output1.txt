To generate a Solidity smart contract based on the provided contexts, you can start by defining the contract structure and importing necessary interfaces and libraries. Here is a basic outline to get you started:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./ILayerZeroUserApplicationConfig.sol";

library Strings {
    bytes16 private constant _HEX_SYMBOLS = "0123456789abcdef";

    function toString(uint256 value) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        // Implementation of converting uint256 to string
    }

    function toHexString(uint256 value) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        // Implementation of converting uint256 to hexadecimal string
    }

    function toHexString(uint256 value, uint256 length) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        // Implementation of converting uint256 to fixed-length hexadecimal string
    }
}

contract YourContractName is ILayerZeroEndpoint {
    // Contract implementation based on the provided interface functions and additional functionalities

    // Implement the send function
    function send(uint16 _dstChainId, bytes calldata _destination, bytes calldata _payload, address payable _refundAddress, address _zroPaymentAddress, bytes calldata _adapterParams) external payable override {
        // Implementation of send function
    }

    // Implement the receivePayload function
    function receivePayload(uint16 _srcChainId, bytes calldata _srcAddress, address _dstAddress, uint64 _nonce, uint _gasLimit, bytes calldata _payload) external override {
        // Implementation of receivePayload function
    }

    // Implement other functions as per the provided interface and additional contract functionalities
}
```

This is a basic structure to start building your Solidity smart contract based on the provided contexts. You can further expand and customize the contract based on your specific requirements and business logic.
