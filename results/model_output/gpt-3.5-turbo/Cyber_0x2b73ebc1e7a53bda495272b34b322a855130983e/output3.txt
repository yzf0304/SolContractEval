To generate a Solidity smart contract based on the provided contexts, you can start by defining the contract structure and importing necessary interfaces and libraries. Here is a basic outline to get you started:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./ILayerZeroUserApplicationConfig.sol";

library Strings {
    bytes16 private constant _HEX_SYMBOLS = "0123456789abcdef";

    function toString(uint256 value) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        // Implementation details
    }

    function toHexString(uint256 value) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        // Implementation details
    }

    function toHexString(uint256 value, uint256 length) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        // Implementation details
    }
}

contract YourContractName is ILayerZeroEndpoint {
    // Contract implementation based on the provided interface functions and additional functionalities

    // Implement the interface functions here

    // Additional contract functions and modifiers

    // Constructor and other contract initialization functions

    // Other utility functions and modifiers

    // Event definitions if needed
}
```

This outline provides a starting point for structuring your Solidity smart contract based on the provided contexts. You can further expand and implement the contract logic, including the interface functions, additional functionalities, constructor, events, and more based on your specific requirements.
