To create a Solidity smart contract that implements the ERC721 standard, you can start by defining the contract and importing the necessary interfaces. Here is a basic example of an ERC721 contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./IERC165.sol";
import "./IERC721.sol";
import "./IERC721Metadata.sol";
import "./IERC721Receiver.sol";
import "./Address.sol";

contract MyERC721Contract is IERC721, IERC721Metadata {
    using Address for address;

    // Mapping from token ID to owner address
    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenOwners;

    // Mapping from owner to number of owned tokens
    mapping(address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;

    // Other necessary state variables and mappings

    // Implement the required functions from the interfaces

    // Implement the ERC721 functions

    // Implement the ERC721Metadata functions

    // Implement any additional functions specific to your contract

}
```

In this example, you would need to fill in the contract with the required functions and logic as per the ERC721 standard. Make sure to implement functions like `balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `safeTransferFrom`, `name`, `symbol`, `totalSupply`, and `tokenURI` as defined in the interfaces.
