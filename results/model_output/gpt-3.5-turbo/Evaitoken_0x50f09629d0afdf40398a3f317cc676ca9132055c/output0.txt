I see you've provided the context and description for the `Evaitoken` smart contract. It looks like you need to implement the functions in the contract based on the provided context. 

Here's a summary of what needs to be done:

1. Implement the functions in the `Evaitoken` contract according to the provided context and descriptions.
2. Ensure the contract uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and underflows.
3. The contract should have functionalities like profit tracking and token burning.
4. The contract should be deployed using compiler version 0.6.10 without introducing any additional contracts, dependencies, or unrelated code.

If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with any part of the implementation, feel free to ask!
