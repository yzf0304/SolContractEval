To generate a Solidity smart contract based on the provided context, you can combine the functionalities of the `ReentrancyGuard`, `Strings`, `Context`, `Ownable`, and `Address` contracts along with the NFT-related functions from the `ERC721` contract. Here is a simplified version of a contract that incorporates some of these features:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

abstract contract ReentrancyGuard {
    uint256 private constant _NOT_ENTERED = 1;
    uint256 private constant _ENTERED = 2;

    uint256 private _status;

    constructor() {
        _status = _NOT_ENTERED;
    }

    modifier nonReentrant() {
        require(_status != _ENTERED, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
        _status = _ENTERED;

        _;

        _status = _NOT_ENTERED;
    }
}

library Strings {
    bytes16 private constant _HEX_SYMBOLS = "0123456789abcdef";

    // Implement the functions from the Strings library here
}

abstract contract Context {
    function _msgSender() internal view virtual returns (address) {
        return msg.sender;
    }

    function _msgData() internal view virtual returns (bytes calldata) {
        return msg.data;
    }
}

abstract contract Ownable is Context {
    address private _owner;

    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);

    constructor() {
        _transferOwnership(_msgSender());
    }

    function owner() public view virtual returns (address) {
        return _owner;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(owner() == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");
        _;
    }

    function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {
        _transferOwnership(address(0));
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual onlyOwner {
        require(newOwner != address(0), "Ownable: new owner is the zero address");
        _transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }

    function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal virtual {
        address oldOwner = _owner;
        _owner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(oldOwner, newOwner);
    }
}

library Address {
    // Implement the functions from the Address library here
}

contract MyNFTContract is ReentrancyGuard, Ownable {
    // Include NFT-related functions and variables here

    // Implement the NFT-related functions from the ERC721 contract here
}
```

You can further expand this contract by adding the specific NFT-related functions and variables you need, such as minting, token URI management, whitelisting, ownership data, and more.
