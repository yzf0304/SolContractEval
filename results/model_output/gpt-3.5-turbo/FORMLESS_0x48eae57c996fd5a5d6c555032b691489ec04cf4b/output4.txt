To generate a Solidity smart contract based on the provided context, you can create a contract that incorporates the functionalities of the abstract contracts and libraries mentioned. Here is a simplified version of a contract that includes some of the key features from the provided context:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

abstract contract ReentrancyGuard {
    uint256 private constant _NOT_ENTERED = 1;
    uint256 private constant _ENTERED = 2;

    uint256 private _status;

    constructor() {
        _status = _NOT_ENTERED;
    }

    modifier nonReentrant() {
        require(_status != _ENTERED, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
        _status = _ENTERED;

        _;

        _status = _NOT_ENTERED;
    }
}

library Strings {
    bytes16 private constant _HEX_SYMBOLS = "0123456789abcdef";

    function toString(uint256 value) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        // Implementation omitted for brevity
    }

    function toHexString(uint256 value) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        // Implementation omitted for brevity
    }
}

abstract contract Context {
    function _msgSender() internal view virtual returns (address) {
        return msg.sender;
    }

    function _msgData() internal view virtual returns (bytes calldata) {
        return msg.data;
    }
}

abstract contract Ownable is Context {
    address private _owner;

    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);

    constructor() {
        _transferOwnership(_msgSender());
    }

    function owner() public view virtual returns (address) {
        return _owner;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(owner() == _msgSender(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");
        _;
    }

    function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {
        _transferOwnership(address(0));
    }

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual onlyOwner {
        require(newOwner != address(0), "Ownable: new owner is the zero address");
        _transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }

    function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal virtual {
        address oldOwner = _owner;
        _owner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(oldOwner, newOwner);
    }
}

library Address {
    function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool) {
        // Implementation omitted for brevity
    }

    function sendValue(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        // Implementation omitted for brevity
    }

    function functionCall(address target, bytes memory data) internal returns (bytes memory) {
        // Implementation omitted for brevity
    }
}

contract YourContract is ReentrancyGuard, Ownable {
    // Implement your contract functionalities here based on the provided context
    // You can add functions related to minting, whitelisting, ownership, etc.
}
```

This contract serves as a starting point and can be expanded upon to include additional functionalities and logic as needed for your specific use case.
