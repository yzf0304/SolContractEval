Based on the provided contract code snippets, it seems like you are working on a decentralized application related to staking and earning rewards. The contracts you shared include functionalities for ownership control, safe math operations, and managing staking pools.

Here are some key points about the contracts:

1. `Context.sol`: Provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data. It is used for intermediate, library-like contracts.

2. `Ownable.sol`: Implements a basic access control mechanism where there is an owner who has exclusive access to specific functions. It includes functions for transferring ownership, renouncing ownership, and checking if the caller is the owner.

3. `SafeMath.sol`: A library for performing safe math operations on unsigned integers, ensuring that operations revert on error conditions like overflow. It includes functions for multiplying and adding unsigned integers with safety checks.

4. The `SafeMath` library also includes functions related to managing staking pools, such as setting maximum stake amounts, updating reward variables, depositing and withdrawing tokens from pools, and handling emergency withdrawals.

Overall, these contracts provide a foundation for building a staking platform where users can stake tokens in pools and earn rewards based on their participation. If you have specific questions or need further clarification on any part of the code, feel free to ask!
