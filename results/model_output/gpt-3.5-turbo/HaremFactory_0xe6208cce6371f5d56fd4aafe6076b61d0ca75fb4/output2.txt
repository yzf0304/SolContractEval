Based on the provided contract code snippets, it seems like you are working on a decentralized application related to staking and earning rewards. The contracts you shared include functionalities for ownership control, safe math operations, and managing staking pools.

Here are some key points based on the code snippets:

1. The `Context` contract provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data. It is used for intermediate, library-like contracts.

2. The `Ownable` contract provides a basic access control mechanism where there is an owner who has exclusive access to specific functions. It includes functions for transferring ownership and checking if the caller is the owner.

3. The `SafeMath` library contains functions for safe mathematical operations, such as multiplication and addition, with checks to prevent overflow.

4. The `SafeMath` library also includes functions related to managing staking pools, such as setting maximum stake amounts, calculating pending rewards, depositing and withdrawing tokens, and emergency withdrawal.

5. The `SafeMath` library has functions for updating reward variables for pools, harvesting rewards, and transferring tokens safely.

Overall, these contracts and libraries provide a foundation for managing ownership, performing safe mathematical operations, and handling staking-related functionalities within your decentralized application.
