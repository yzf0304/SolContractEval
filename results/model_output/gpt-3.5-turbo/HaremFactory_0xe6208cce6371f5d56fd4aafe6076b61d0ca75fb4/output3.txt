Based on the provided contract code snippets, it seems like you are working on a decentralized application related to staking and earning rewards in the form of "Harems." The contracts include functionality for ownership control, stake management, reward distribution, and emergency withdrawal.

Here are some key points based on the code snippets:
1. The `Context` contract provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data.
2. The `Ownable` contract implements a basic access control mechanism where specific functions can only be accessed by the owner.
3. The `SafeMath` library contains functions for safe mathematical operations, such as multiplication and addition with overflow checks.
4. The `SafeMath` library also includes functions for managing stake pools, calculating pending rewards, depositing and withdrawing tokens, and emergency withdrawal.
