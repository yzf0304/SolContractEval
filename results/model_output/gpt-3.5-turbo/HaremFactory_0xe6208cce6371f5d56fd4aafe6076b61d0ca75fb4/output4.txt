Based on the provided contract code snippets, it seems like you are working on a decentralized application related to waifus and harems. The contracts you shared include functionalities for context handling, ownership management, and safe math operations.

Here's a brief overview of the key contracts:

1. **Context.sol**: This contract provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data. It is designed for use in intermediate, library-like contracts.

2. **Ownable.sol**: This contract module provides a basic access control mechanism where there is an owner who has exclusive access to specific functions. It includes functions for transferring ownership, renouncing ownership, and checking if the caller is the owner.

3. **SafeMath.sol**: This library contains functions for performing safe mathematical operations on unsigned integers. It includes functions for multiplication, addition, and various operations related to managing pools, staking, and rewards.

It appears that the contracts are part of a larger system that involves staking tokens in pools to earn rewards in the form of harems. The system allows users to deposit tokens, withdraw them, and harvest pending rewards from multiple pools.
