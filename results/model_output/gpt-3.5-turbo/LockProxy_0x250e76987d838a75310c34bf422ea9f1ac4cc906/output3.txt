To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code snippets:

1. The `Context` contract provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data. It is used for intermediate, library-like contracts.

2. The `Ownable` contract is a module that provides a basic access control mechanism where there is an owner who has exclusive access to specific functions. It includes functions to transfer ownership, check ownership, and restrict functions to the owner.

3. The `Utils` library contains various utility functions for converting between data types, locking and unlocking tokens across chains, getting balances, and handling token transfers.
