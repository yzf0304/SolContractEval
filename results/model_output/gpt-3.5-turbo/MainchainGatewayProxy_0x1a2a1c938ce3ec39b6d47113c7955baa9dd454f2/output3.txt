I see you have provided the context and description for the `Registry` smart contract. It looks like you need to implement the functions in the `Registry` contract based on the provided context. Here is a summary of the functions you need to implement:

1. `getContract`: Retrieves the address of a contract by its name.
2. `isTokenMapped`: Checks if a token is mapped for a given standard on either the mainchain or sidechain.
3. `updateContract`: Updates the address of a contract by its name.
4. `mapToken`: Maps a mainchain token to a sidechain token with a specified standard.
5. `clearMapToken`: Clears the mapping for a given mainchain and sidechain token pair.
6. `getMappedToken`: Retrieves the mapped token details for a given token address and chain type.

You can start by implementing these functions in the `Registry` contract. Let me know if you need any further assistance with the implementation.
