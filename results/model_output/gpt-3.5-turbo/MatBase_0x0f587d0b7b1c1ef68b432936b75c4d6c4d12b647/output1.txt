Based on the provided contract code, it seems to be a Solidity smart contract for a token sale. The contract includes functionalities for managing token transfers, ownership, whitelisting, and token minting.

Here is a brief overview of the key components in the contract:

1. SafeMath Library: Contains functions for safe mathematical operations to prevent overflows and underflows.

2. Ownable Contract: Defines ownership functionality with an owner address and a transferOwnership function.

3. ERC20 and BasicToken Contracts: Implement basic ERC20 token functionalities like balance tracking and transfers.

4. StandardToken Contract: Extends ERC20 and BasicToken contracts to include additional functionalities like allowance management and transferFrom.

5. MatBase Contract: This contract appears to be the main token sale contract. It includes functions for token minting, handling token purchases, whitelisting, and converting presale tokens to main sale tokens.

Overall, the contract structure follows standard ERC20 token standards with additional features for managing a token sale, including whitelisting and token conversion.
