Based on the provided contract code, it seems to be a Solidity smart contract for a token sale. The contract includes functionalities for managing token transfers, ownership, whitelisting, and token minting.

Here is a brief overview of the main components of the contract:

1. SafeMath Library: Contains functions for safe mathematical operations to prevent overflows and underflows.

2. Ownable Contract: Manages ownership of the contract, allowing the owner to transfer ownership to another address.

3. ERC20 and BasicToken Contracts: Implement basic ERC20 token functionalities like balance tracking and transfers.

4. StandardToken Contract: Extends ERC20 and BasicToken contracts to include additional functionalities like token allowances and transfer approvals.

5. MatBase Contract: Represents the main token sale contract with functions for token minting, fund forwarding, token purchases, whitelist management, and presale token conversion.

Overall, the contract structure follows standard ERC20 token standards with additional features for managing a token sale, including whitelisting and presale token conversion.
