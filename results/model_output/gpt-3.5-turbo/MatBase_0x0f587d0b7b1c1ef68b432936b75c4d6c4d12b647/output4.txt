Based on the provided contract code, it seems to be a Solidity smart contract for a token sale. The contract includes functionalities for managing token transfers, ownership, whitelisting, and token minting.

Here is a brief overview of the key components in the contract:

1. SafeMath Library: Contains functions for safe mathematical operations to prevent overflows and underflows.
2. Ownable Contract: Defines an owner with exclusive access control over certain functions.
3. ERC20 Interface: Specifies the standard functions for an ERC20 token.
4. BasicToken Contract: Implements basic token functionality like transfers and balance queries.
5. StandardToken Contract: Extends BasicToken and adds allowance management for token transfers.
6. TokenSale Contract: Handles the token sale process, including minting tokens, managing whitelists, and converting presale tokens.

Overall, the contract structure follows common patterns for token sales and includes necessary security measures like SafeMath for secure arithmetic operations. If you have specific questions or need further details on any part of the contract, feel free to ask!
