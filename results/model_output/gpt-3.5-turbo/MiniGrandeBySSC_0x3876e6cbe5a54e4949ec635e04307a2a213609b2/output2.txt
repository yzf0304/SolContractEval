To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code snippets:

1. The `ReentrancyGuard` abstract contract helps prevent reentrancy attacks by managing the status of a function call to prevent reentry.
2. The `Strings` library provides functions to convert uint256 values to strings and hexadecimal strings.
3. The `Context` abstract contract defines internal functions to access the sender and data of a message.
4. The `Ownable` abstract contract implements ownership functionality, allowing for ownership transfer and onlyOwner modifiers.
5. The `Address` library includes functions to check if an address is a contract, send value to an address, and perform function calls.

Additionally, the provided code includes functions related to minting tokens, setting prices, managing ownership, and other functionalities specific to a token minting contract. These functions are guarded by modifiers and can only be called by the contract owner.
