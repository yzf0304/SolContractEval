To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code snippets:

1. The `ReentrancyGuard` abstract contract helps prevent reentrancy attacks by managing the status of a function to ensure it is not called recursively.
2. The `Strings` library provides functions for converting uint256 values to strings and hexadecimal strings.
3. The `Context` abstract contract defines internal functions for accessing the sender and data of a message.
4. The `Ownable` abstract contract implements ownership functionality, allowing for ownership transfer and only allowing the owner to perform certain actions.
5. The `Address` library includes functions for checking if an address is a contract, sending value to an address, and calling functions on another contract.

Additionally, the contract includes various functions and modifiers related to minting tokens, setting parameters like mint prices and collection size, managing ownership, and setting metadata URIs.
