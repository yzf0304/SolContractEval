To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code snippets:

1. The `ReentrancyGuard` abstract contract helps prevent reentrancy attacks by managing the status of calls to a specific function.
2. The `Strings` library provides functions for converting uint256 values to strings and hexadecimal strings.
3. The `Context` abstract contract defines internal functions for accessing the sender and data of a message.
4. The `Ownable` abstract contract implements ownership functionality, allowing for ownership transfer and onlyOwner modifiers.
5. The `Address` library includes functions for checking if an address is a contract and for sending value to an address.
6. The main contract includes functions for managing minting of tokens, setting prices, sizes, and other parameters related to a token collection.

These contracts provide a foundation for creating a token collection with features like ownership control, minting restrictions, pricing settings, and more.
