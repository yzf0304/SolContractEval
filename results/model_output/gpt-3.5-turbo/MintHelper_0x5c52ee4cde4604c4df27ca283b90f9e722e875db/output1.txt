I see you have provided a detailed context for the `MintHelper` smart contract. To complete the contract, you need to implement the functions as described in the context. Here is a brief summary of what needs to be done:

1. Implement the `setMintableToken` function to allow the owner to set the mintable token address.
2. Implement the `paymentSuccessful` function to check if a payment with a given ID was successful.
3. Implement the `proxyMint` function to proxy the minting of a token using the provided nonce and challenge digest.
4. Implement the `withdraw` function to allow the owner to withdraw any ETH held by the contract.
5. Implement the `send` function to send a specified amount of tokens to a destination address.
6. Implement the `multisend` function to send tokens to multiple destination addresses in a single transaction.

You can start by filling in the missing parts of the functions based on the provided descriptions. Let me know if you need any further assistance with the implementation.
