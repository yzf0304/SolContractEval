I see you have provided the context and description for the `MintHelper` smart contract. To complete the contract, you need to implement the functions as described in the context. Here is a basic outline of how you can implement the missing functions:

1. **setMintableToken**: This function allows the owner to set the mintable token address. Only the owner should be able to call this function. You need to update the `mintableToken` state variable with the provided token address.

2. **paymentSuccessful**: This function checks if a payment with a given ID was successful by looking up the status in the `successfulPayments` mapping.

3. **proxyMint**: This function proxies the minting of a token using the provided nonce and challenge digest. It should call the `mint` function on the `mintableToken` contract and return the success status.

4. **withdraw**: This function allows the owner to withdraw any ETH held by the contract. Only the owner should be able to call this function.

5. **send**: This function sends a specified amount of tokens to a destination address. Only the owner should be able to call this function.

6. **multisend**: This function sends tokens to multiple destination addresses in a single transaction. It should ensure that the payment ID is unique and not already marked as successful.

You can now proceed to implement these functions based on the provided descriptions. Let me know if you need further assistance with the implementation.
