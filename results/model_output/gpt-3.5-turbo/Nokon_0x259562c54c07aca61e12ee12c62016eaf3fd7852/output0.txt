The provided smart contract for Nokon Token seems to be well-structured and includes the necessary functions to implement the ERC20 standard along with additional functionalities for presell, buying, and administrative operations. 

To complete the contract, you would need to implement the following functions:

1. `toAsciiString(address x)`: This function should convert an address to its ASCII string representation.
2. `char(bytes1 b)`: This helper function should convert a byte to its corresponding character.
3. `getRate()`: This function should return the current rate.
4. Implement the logic for the `buy()` function to allow token purchase during the presale period.
5. Implement the `closePresell()` and `openPresell()` functions to manage the presale period.
6. Implement the `getEthBalance()`, `transferEth()`, `supply()`, `presellStatus()`, and `getAddress()` functions as described in the comments.

Make sure to test the contract thoroughly to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
