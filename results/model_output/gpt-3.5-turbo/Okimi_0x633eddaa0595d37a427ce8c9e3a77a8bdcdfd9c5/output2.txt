To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code:

1. The contract inherits from `Context` and provides basic access control through the `Ownable` contract.
2. The `Ownable` contract allows for setting an owner who has exclusive access to specific functions.
3. The owner can transfer ownership to another account and renounce ownership.
4. The contract includes modifiers like `onlyOwner` to restrict access to certain functions.
5. It includes functions for minting NFTs, refunding excess ETH, checking sale status, setting sale configurations, reserving NFTs, setting base URI, withdrawing contract balance, and more.
6. The contract also includes functions to get information about minted NFTs, ownership data for specific tokens, and the total number of minted NFTs.
7. Additionally, there is a function to receive Ether without reverting.
