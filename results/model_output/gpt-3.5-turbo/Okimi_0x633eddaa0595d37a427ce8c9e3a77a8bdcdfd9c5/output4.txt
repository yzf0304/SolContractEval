To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code:

1. The contract inherits from `Context` and provides basic access control through the `Ownable` contract.
2. The `Ownable` contract allows for setting an owner, transferring ownership, and restricting functions to only the owner.
3. It includes modifiers like `onlyOwner` to restrict access to certain functions.
4. The contract implements functions for minting NFTs, refunding excess ETH, checking sale status, setting sale configurations, reserving NFTs, setting base URI, withdrawing contract balance, and more.
5. It includes functions to get information about minted NFTs, ownership data for tokens, total minted NFTs, and a fallback function to receive Ether.
