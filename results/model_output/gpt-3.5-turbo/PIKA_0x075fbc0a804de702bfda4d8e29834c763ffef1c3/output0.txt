To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code:

1. The contract includes a SafeMath library for safe arithmetic operations.
2. It defines an abstract contract `Context` with internal functions `_msgSender` and `_msgData`.
3. The `Owned` contract inherits from `Context` and implements ownership functionality with `onlyOwner` modifier.
4. It includes an interface `ERC20` for ERC20 token functions.
5. Interfaces `IUniswapV2Factory` and `IUniswapV2Router02` are defined for Uniswap interactions.
6. The main contract initializes with token details, ownership setup, Uniswap pair creation, and timestamp recording.
7. Various functions are implemented for token swapping, fee extraction, liquidity addition, and more.
8. The contract also includes a fallback function to receive ETH.
