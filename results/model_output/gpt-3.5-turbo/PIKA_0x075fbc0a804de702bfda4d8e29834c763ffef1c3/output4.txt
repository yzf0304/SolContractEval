To generate a Solidity smart contract code based on the provided contexts, you can start by defining the contract structure and importing necessary interfaces and libraries. Here is a basic outline to get you started:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./SafeMath.sol";

abstract contract Context {
    function _msgSender() internal view virtual returns (address payable) {
        return msg.sender;
    }

    function _msgData() internal view virtual returns (bytes memory) {
        this; // silence state mutability warning without generating bytecode
        return msg.data;
    }
}

contract Owned is Context {
    address payable owner;
    address payable newOwner;

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(_msgSender() == owner, "Ownable: caller is not the owner");
        _;
    }

    function changeOwner(address payable _newOwner) external onlyOwner {
        require(_newOwner != address(0), "Ownable: new owner is the zero address");
        newOwner = _newOwner;
    }

    function acceptOwnership() external {
        if (_msgSender() == newOwner) {
            owner = newOwner;
        }
    }
}

interface ERC20 {
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) external returns (bool success);
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) external returns (bool success);
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) external returns (bool success);
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) external view returns (uint256 remaining);
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
}

interface IUniswapV2Factory {
    // Define interface functions
}

interface IUniswapV2Router02 {
    // Define interface functions
}

contract YourContractName is Owned {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    // Define contract variables and events

    constructor() {
        // Initialize contract variables and set owner
    }

    // Implement contract functions and additional logic based on your requirements

    receive() external payable {
        // Fallback function to receive ETH
    }
}
```

You can further expand and customize this outline based on your specific requirements and business logic. Let me know if you need any more assistance or specific details in the contract code generation.
