The provided code snippets include Solidity smart contracts for a basic access control mechanism and a library for safe arithmetic operations. The `Ownable` contract allows for ownership management, where specific functions can be restricted to the contract owner using the `onlyOwner` modifier. It also includes functions for transferring ownership and renouncing ownership.

The `SafeMath` library provides functions for performing arithmetic operations with overflow checks to prevent unexpected behavior due to integer overflow.

If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any part of the code, feel free to ask!
