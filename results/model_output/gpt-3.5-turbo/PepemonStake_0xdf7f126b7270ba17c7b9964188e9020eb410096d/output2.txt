This Solidity smart contract consists of three main components:

1. **Context Contract**: This contract provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data. It includes functions like `_msgSender()` and `_msgData()` to access this information.

2. **Ownable Contract**: This contract provides a basic access control mechanism where there is an owner who has exclusive access to specific functions. It includes functions like `onlyOwner`, `isOwner`, `renounceOwnership`, and `transferOwnership`.

3. **SafeMath Library**: This library provides arithmetic operations with added overflow checks to prevent bugs that can occur due to overflow. It includes functions like `add` and `sub`.

Additionally, there are functions related to managing staking events, such as creating events, closing events, staking cards, claiming rewards, and canceling participation. These functions ensure the proper handling of staking events and user interactions within the contract.
