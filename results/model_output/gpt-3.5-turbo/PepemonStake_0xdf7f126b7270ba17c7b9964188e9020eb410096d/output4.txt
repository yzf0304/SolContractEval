The provided Solidity code includes contracts for managing ownership, access control, and arithmetic operations with overflow checks. Here's a brief overview of each contract:

1. **Context Contract**: Provides information about the current execution context, including the sender of the transaction and its data. It should be used via inheritance and not deployed directly.

2. **Ownable Contract**: Implements a basic access control mechanism where there is an owner who has exclusive access to specific functions. It includes functions to transfer ownership, check if the caller is the owner, and modifiers to restrict access.

3. **SafeMath Library**: Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow checks to prevent common bugs related to overflow. It includes functions for safe addition and subtraction of unsigned integers.

4. **StakingEvent Contract**: Contains functions related to managing staking events, such as creating new events, closing events, staking cards, claiming rewards, and canceling participation. It also includes internal functions for withdrawing staked cards and checking if a value is in an array.

5. **ERC1155 Interface Functions**: Implements functions required by the ERC1155 token standard for receiving single and batch transfers and checking interface support.

These contracts and libraries provide a foundation for building a staking platform with ownership control, safe arithmetic operations, and interaction with ERC1155 tokens.
