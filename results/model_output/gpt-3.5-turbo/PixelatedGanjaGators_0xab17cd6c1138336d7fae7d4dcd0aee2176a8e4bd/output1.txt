To generate a Solidity smart contract that utilizes the provided OpenZeppelin libraries for string operations and address handling, you can create a contract that incorporates functions from the `Strings` and `Address` libraries. Here is an example contract that demonstrates how you can use these libraries:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";

contract MyContract {
    using Strings for uint256;
    using Address for address;

    function convertToString(uint256 value) public pure returns (string memory) {
        return value.toString();
    }

    function convertToHexString(uint256 value) public pure returns (string memory) {
        return value.toHexString();
    }

    function checkIfContract(address account) public view returns (bool) {
        return account.isContract();
    }

    function sendEther(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        recipient.sendValue(amount);
    }
}
```

In this contract:
- The `Strings` library is used to convert a `uint256` to its ASCII string representation.
- The `Address` library is used to check if an address is a contract and to send Ether to an address.

You can further expand this contract by adding more functions that utilize the functionalities provided by the OpenZeppelin libraries for address and string operations.
