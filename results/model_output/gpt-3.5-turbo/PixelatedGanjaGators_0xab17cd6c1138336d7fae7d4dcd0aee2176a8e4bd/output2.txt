To interact with ERC721 tokens in a Solidity smart contract, you can utilize the functions provided in the OpenZeppelin Address library. Here is an example of how you can use some of these functions in your contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";

contract MyERC721Contract {
    using Address for address;

    function transferToken(address tokenContract, address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
        require(tokenContract.isContract(), "Token address is not a contract");

        // Perform the token transfer
        // You can add additional checks or logic here before transferring the token
        // For example, checking ownership or approvals

        // Call the _transfer function from the Address library
        Address.functionCall(tokenContract, abi.encodeWithSignature("transfer(address,uint256)", to, tokenId));
    }

    function mintToken(address tokenContract, address to, uint256 quantity, bytes memory data) public {
        require(tokenContract.isContract(), "Token address is not a contract");

        // Mint tokens to the specified address with additional data
        Address.functionCall(tokenContract, abi.encodeWithSignature("_safeMint(address,uint256,bytes)", to, quantity, data));
    }

    // Add more functions as needed for interacting with ERC721 tokens
}
```

In this example, the `transferToken` function demonstrates how you can transfer an ERC721 token to another address, and the `mintToken` function shows how you can mint new tokens with additional data. You can expand on these functions or create new ones based on your specific requirements for interacting with ERC721 tokens in your Solidity smart contract.
