To interact with ERC721 tokens in a Solidity smart contract, you can utilize the functions provided in the OpenZeppelin Address library. Here is an example of how you can use some of these functions in your contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";

contract MyERC721Contract {
    using Address for address;

    function transferToken(address tokenContract, address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
        require(tokenContract.isContract(), "Token address is not a contract");

        // Perform the token transfer
        // You can add additional checks or logic here before transferring the token
        // For example, checking ownership or approvals

        // Call the _transfer function from the Address library
        Address.functionCall(tokenContract, abi.encodeWithSignature("transfer(address,uint256)", to, tokenId));
    }

    function mintToken(address tokenContract, address to, uint256 quantity, bytes memory data) public {
        require(tokenContract.isContract(), "Token address is not a contract");

        // Mint tokens to the specified address with additional data
        Address.functionCall(tokenContract, abi.encodeWithSignature("_safeMint(address,uint256,bytes)", to, quantity, data));
    }

    function approveToken(address tokenContract, address to, uint256 tokenId, address owner) public {
        require(tokenContract.isContract(), "Token address is not a contract");

        // Approve an address to operate on a specific token
        Address.functionCall(tokenContract, abi.encodeWithSignature("_approve(address,uint256,address)", to, tokenId, owner));
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MyERC721Contract` contract uses the Address library functions to interact with ERC721 tokens. You can customize these functions based on your specific requirements for token transfers, minting, and approvals.
