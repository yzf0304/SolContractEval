To generate a Solidity smart contract that utilizes the provided OpenZeppelin libraries for string operations and address-related functions, you can create a contract that incorporates these libraries. Here is an example contract that uses the Strings and Address libraries:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";

contract MyContract {
    using Strings for uint256;
    using Address for address;

    function uintToString(uint256 value) public pure returns (string memory) {
        return value.toString();
    }

    function uintToHexString(uint256 value) public pure returns (string memory) {
        return value.toHexString();
    }

    function isContract(address account) public view returns (bool) {
        return account.isContract();
    }

    function sendEther(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        recipient.sendValue(amount);
    }
}
```

In this contract:
- The `using` keyword is used to enable the functionality provided by the Strings and Address libraries.
- The `uintToString` function converts a uint256 value to its ASCII string decimal representation using the Strings library.
- The `uintToHexString` function converts a uint256 value to its ASCII string hexadecimal representation using the Strings library.
- The `isContract` function checks if an address corresponds to a contract using the Address library.
- The `sendEther` function sends Ether to a specified recipient address using the Address library.

You can further expand this contract by adding more functions that leverage the capabilities of the OpenZeppelin libraries for string operations and address-related functionalities.
