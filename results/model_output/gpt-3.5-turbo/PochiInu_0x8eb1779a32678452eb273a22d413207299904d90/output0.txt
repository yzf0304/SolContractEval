To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code:

- The contract is an ERC20 token implementation with additional functionality for managing fees, liquidity, and token swaps.
- It includes functions for transferring tokens, updating sell fees, excluding addresses from fees, and handling token swaps for ETH.
- There are internal functions for managing token transfers with restrictions and fees, swapping tokens for ETH, adding liquidity to Uniswap V2 pair, and distributing tokens and ETH to different wallets.
- The contract also allows transferring foreign tokens, withdrawing stuck ETH, and setting operations and Yasha addresses.
