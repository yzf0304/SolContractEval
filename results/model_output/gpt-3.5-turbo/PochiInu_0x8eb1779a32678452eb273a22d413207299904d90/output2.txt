To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code:

- The contract is an ERC20 token implementation that includes standard ERC20 functions and events.
- It extends the Context, IERC20, and IERC20Metadata interfaces.
- It includes functions for transferring tokens, setting allowances, and retrieving token information.
- The contract also implements additional functionality such as updating sell fees, excluding addresses from fees, handling token transfers with restrictions and fees, swapping tokens for ETH, adding liquidity to Uniswap V2 pair, and transferring foreign tokens.
- There are functions for withdrawing stuck ETH, setting operations and Yasha addresses, and swapping contract-held tokens for ETH to distribute to liquidity, operations, and Yasha wallets.
