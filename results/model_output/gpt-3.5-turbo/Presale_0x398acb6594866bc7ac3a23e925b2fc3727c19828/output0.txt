Based on the provided Solidity code snippets, it seems like you are working on implementing a token sale contract with discount tiers and purchase limits. Here are some key points and suggestions based on the code:

1. The `Discounts` library defines structures for discount tiers and purchase calculations. It includes functions for adding tiers and purchasing tokens based on available funds and discount levels.

2. The `Limits` library handles the administration of the token sale, including setting rates, limits, adding tiers, authorizing participants, and handling withdrawals.

3. The `Presale` contract seems to be the main contract that utilizes the `Discounts` and `Limits` libraries to manage the token sale process.

4. Make sure to thoroughly test the functionality of each component, especially the purchase logic and discount calculations, to ensure accuracy and security.

5. Consider adding additional error handling and input validation to prevent potential vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior.
