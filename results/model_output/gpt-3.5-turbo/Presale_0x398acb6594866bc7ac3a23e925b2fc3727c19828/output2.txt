Based on the provided Solidity code snippets, it seems like you are working on implementing a token sale contract with discount tiers and purchase limits. Here are some key points and suggestions based on the code:

1. The `Discounts` library defines structures for discount tiers and token purchase calculations. It includes functions for adding tiers and purchasing tokens based on available discounts and funds.

2. The `Limits` library handles the administration of the token sale, including setting rates, limits, adding tiers, authorizing participants, and handling withdrawals.

3. Make sure to properly set the base purchase rate, define purchasing limits, and add tiers with appropriate discounts and available supplies.

4. Implement the necessary modifiers to ensure that only authorized participants can purchase tokens, the base rate is set, the contract is capped, and the contract owns the token.

5. Consider testing the contract thoroughly to ensure that all functionalities work as intended and handle edge cases properly.
