Based on the provided Solidity code snippets, it appears to be defining two libraries: `Discounts` and `Limits`. The `Discounts` library handles the management of discount tiers and token purchases, while the `Limits` library seems to be related to setting purchase limits and managing the presale contract.

Here are some key functionalities and structures from the code snippets:

1. **Discounts Library**:
   - Defines a `Collection` struct to group tiers with a base purchase rate.
   - Contains a `Tier` struct for each discount tier with discount and available token properties.
   - Provides functions to add tiers and purchase tokens based on specified criteria.
   - Includes price math functions to calculate token purchases and costs at different tiers.

2. **Limits Library**:
   - Defines a `PurchaseRecord` struct to track purchase details.
   - Contains functions for setting rates, limiting purchases, adding tiers, authorizing participants, and withdrawing funds.
   - Implements a purchase interface for authorized participants and view functions to retrieve purchase limits and tier information.
   - Includes modifiers to ensure conditions are met before executing certain functions.

Overall, the code seems to be part of a system for managing a token presale, handling discounts, purchase limits, and token purchases based on specified tiers and rates.
