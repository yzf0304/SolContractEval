Based on the provided Solidity code snippets, it seems like you are working on implementing a token sale contract with discount tiers and purchase limits. Here are some key points and suggestions based on the code:

1. The `Discounts` library defines structures for discount tiers and purchase calculations. It includes functions for adding tiers and purchasing tokens based on available discounts and funds.

2. The `Limits` library handles the administration of the token sale, including setting rates, limits, adding tiers, authorizing participants, and handling withdrawals.

3. The contract seems to be well-structured with separate libraries for different functionalities, promoting code reusability and modularity.

4. Ensure that the necessary SafeMath library is imported for handling arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.

5. Consider adding more error handling and input validation to ensure the contract's robustness and security.

6. Test the contract thoroughly, especially the purchase and limit functionalities, to ensure they work as intended and handle edge cases correctly.

If you have specific questions or need further assistance with any part of the contract implementation, feel free to ask!
