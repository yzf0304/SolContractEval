To implement a Solidity smart contract that utilizes the `ReentrancyGuard` and `Strings` libraries from OpenZeppelin Contracts, you can follow the structure below:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol";

contract MyNFTContract is ReentrancyGuard {
    using Strings for uint256;

    // Define state variables and other contract functionalities here

    constructor() {
        // Initialize any variables or settings here
    }

    // Implement your contract's functions using the ReentrancyGuard modifier and Strings library as needed

    function myFunction() public nonReentrant {
        // Function implementation with nonReentrancy protection
    }

    function convertToString(uint256 value) public pure returns (string memory) {
        return value.toString();
    }

    // Other functions and contract logic can be added here

}
```

In this contract structure:
- The `MyNFTContract` contract inherits from `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrant calls.
- The `Strings` library is imported and used to convert `uint256` values to strings.
- You can define your contract's state variables, constructor, and functions as needed.
- Ensure to apply the `nonReentrant` modifier to functions that should not be called reentrantly.
- Customize the contract with your specific NFT minting logic and other functionalities.

Feel free to adapt this template to suit your specific requirements and add more functionality as needed.
