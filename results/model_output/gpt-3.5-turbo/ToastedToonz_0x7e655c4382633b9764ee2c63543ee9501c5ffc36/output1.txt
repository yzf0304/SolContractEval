To generate a Solidity smart contract based on the provided contexts, you can start by defining your contract and importing the necessary libraries. Here is a basic structure to get you started:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Strings.sol";
import "./Context.sol";
import "./Address.sol";

contract YourContract is Context {
    using Strings for uint256;
    using Address for address;

    // Define your contract's state variables and events here

    // Implement your contract's functions based on the provided contexts

    // You can start by implementing functions like _safeMint, _transfer, _approve, etc.

    // Feel free to customize and expand upon this template as needed
}
```

This template includes the import statements for the provided libraries and sets up a basic contract structure. You can then proceed to implement the specific functions and logic based on the contexts provided in the code snippets you shared.
