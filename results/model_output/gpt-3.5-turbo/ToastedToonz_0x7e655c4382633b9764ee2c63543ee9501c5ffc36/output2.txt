To generate a Solidity smart contract based on the provided contexts, you can start by defining your contract and importing the necessary libraries. Here is a basic structure to get you started:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Strings.sol";
import "./Context.sol";
import "./Address.sol";

contract YourContract is Context {
    using Strings for uint256;
    using Address for address;

    // Define your contract's state variables and functions here

    // Example function using the Strings library
    function convertToString(uint256 value) public pure returns (string memory) {
        return Strings.toString(value);
    }

    // Example function using the Address library
    function checkIfContract(address account) public view returns (bool) {
        return Address.isContract(account);
    }

    // You can continue adding your contract logic based on the provided contexts

}
```

This is a basic template to start building your Solidity smart contract. You can expand on this template by adding more functions and logic based on your specific requirements and the functionalities provided in the provided contexts.
