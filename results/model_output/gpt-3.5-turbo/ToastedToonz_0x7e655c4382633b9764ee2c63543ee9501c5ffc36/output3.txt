To generate a Solidity smart contract based on the provided contexts, you can start by defining your main contract and importing the necessary libraries. Here is a basic structure to get you started:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Strings.sol";
import "./Context.sol";
import "./Address.sol";

contract YourContract is Context {
    using Strings for uint256;
    using Address for address;

    // Define your contract's state variables and functions here

    // Example function using the Strings library
    function convertToString(uint256 value) public pure returns (string memory) {
        return value.toString();
    }

    // Example function using the Address library
    function checkIfContract(address account) public view returns (bool) {
        return account.isContract();
    }
}
```

In this structure, you import the `Strings`, `Context`, and `Address` libraries and use them within your contract. You can then define your contract's state variables and functions based on your specific requirements.

Feel free to expand on this structure by adding more functions and logic as needed for your smart contract development.
