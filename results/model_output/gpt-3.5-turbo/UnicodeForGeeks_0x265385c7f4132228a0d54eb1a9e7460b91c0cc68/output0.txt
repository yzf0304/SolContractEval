To create a Solidity smart contract that utilizes the provided OpenZeppelin libraries, you can start by importing the necessary contracts and libraries. Here is an example contract that uses the Context, ERC165, Strings, and Address libraries:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/introspection/ERC165.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";

contract MyContract is Context, ERC165 {
    using Strings for uint256;
    using Address for address;

    // Your contract code here

}
```

In this example, the `MyContract` contract inherits from `Context` and `ERC165` contracts, and it also uses the `Strings` and `Address` libraries for string operations and address-related functions, respectively. You can then proceed to implement your specific contract logic within the `MyContract` contract.
