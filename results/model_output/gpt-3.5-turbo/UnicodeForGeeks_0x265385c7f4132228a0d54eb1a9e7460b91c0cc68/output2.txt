To create a Solidity smart contract that utilizes the provided OpenZeppelin libraries, you can start by importing the necessary contracts and libraries. Here is an example of how you can structure your contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Address.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721, Context {
    using Strings for uint256;
    using Address for address;

    constructor() ERC721("MyNFT", "MNFT") {}

    function mintNFT(address to, uint256 tokenId) external {
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
    }

    function burnNFT(uint256 tokenId) external {
        _burn(tokenId);
    }

    function transferNFT(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external {
        _transfer(from, to, tokenId);
    }
}
```

In this example, the contract `MyNFT` inherits from `ERC721` and uses the `Context` contract for context information. It also utilizes the `Strings` and `Address` libraries for string operations and address-related functions, respectively.

You can further customize this contract based on your specific requirements for minting, burning, and transferring NFTs. Let me know if you need any more assistance with your Solidity smart contract development.
