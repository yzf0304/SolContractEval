This code snippet appears to be a SafeMath library in Solidity, which provides functions for safe arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The library includes functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations with overflow checks.

Additionally, there seems to be a token contract template or interface defined with functions related to token transfers, allowances, minting, burning, and setting decimals. This template likely serves as a foundation for creating ERC-20 compliant tokens in Solidity.
