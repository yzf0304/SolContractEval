This code snippet appears to be a SafeMath library in Solidity, which provides secure arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The library includes functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operations with overflow checks.

Additionally, there seems to be a token contract template or interface defined with functions for managing token transfers, allowances, minting, burning, and setting decimals. These functions are essential for creating ERC20-compliant tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
