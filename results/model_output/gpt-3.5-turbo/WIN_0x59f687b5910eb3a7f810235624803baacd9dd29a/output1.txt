I see you have provided a template for a Solidity smart contract named `WIN`. You have also included a SafeMath library for handling arithmetic operations safely. 

To complete the `WIN` contract, you need to implement the functions `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `burn` as per the provided descriptions. Here is a brief outline of what each function should do:

1. `transfer`: Transfer tokens from the sender's account to a recipient.
2. `transferFrom`: Transfer tokens on behalf of another address.
3. `approve`: Approve a spender to spend a specified amount of tokens on behalf of the sender.
4. `burn`: Burn a specified amount of tokens from the sender's balance.

You can start by implementing the logic inside these functions based on the provided context and descriptions. If you encounter any specific issues or need further assistance with the implementation, feel free to ask!
