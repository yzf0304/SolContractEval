To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code:

1. The contract includes functions for minting NFTs with restrictions on quantity and payment.
2. It tracks the total supply of tokens and the base URI for the NFTs.
3. The contract allows the owner to reveal the NFTs, set the cost for minting, set maximum mint amounts, and manage the whitelist for free mints.
4. There are functions to set URIs for the NFTs, pause/unpause minting, and withdraw the contract's balance to the owner's address.
