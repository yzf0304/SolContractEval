To summarize the provided Solidity smart contract code:

1. The contract includes functions for minting NFTs with restrictions on quantity and payment.
2. It tracks the total supply of tokens and the base URI for the NFTs.
3. The owner can reveal the NFTs, set the cost for minting, set maximum mint amounts, and manage the URI settings.
4. The contract allows pausing and unpausing minting, whitelisting users for free mints, and withdrawing the contract's balance to the owner's address.
