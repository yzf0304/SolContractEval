### Explanation of the Implementation

1. **Freeze Function**:
    - Verifies that the `target` is not already frozen.
    - Updates the `_frozen` mapping to set the `target` address's frozen status to `true`.
    - Emits the `Freeze` event.
    - Returns `true` to indicate the operation was successful.

2. **Unfreeze Function**:
    - Verifies that the `target` is currently frozen.
    - Updates the `_frozen` mapping to set the `target` address's frozen status to `false`.
    - Emits the `Unfreeze` event.
    - Returns `true` to indicate the operation was successful.

3. **isFrozen Function**:
    - Allows anyone to check if a specific `target` address is currently frozen by returning the value from the `_frozen` mapping.

4. **whenNotFrozen Modifier**:
    - Ensures that certain functions can only be executed if the `target` address is not frozen. This modifier can be added to other functions as needed for additional functionality.

This contract adheres to the requirements and integrates seamlessly with the `Ownable` contract as described.
