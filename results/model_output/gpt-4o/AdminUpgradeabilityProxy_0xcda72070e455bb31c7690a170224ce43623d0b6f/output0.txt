### Explanation:
1. **Constructor**: 
   - The constructor asserts the correctness of the EIP-1967 slot.
   - Sets the implementation address using `_setImplementation`.
   - Makes an optional delegate call to initialize state in the implementation contract, if `_data` is provided.

2. **_implementation**: 
   - Fetches the implementation address stored in the `IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT`.

3. **_upgradeTo**:
   - Updates the implementation using `_setImplementation`.
   - Emits the `Upgraded` event to log the upgrade.

4. **_setImplementation**:
   - Verifies that `newImplementation` is indeed a contract using `Address.isContract`.
   - Updates the `IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT` with the new implementation address.

5. **Fallback and Receive Functions**:
   - The `fallback` and `receive` functions inherit their behavior from the `Proxy` contract to delegate calls to the implementation. They handle ETH transfers and function calls intended for the implementation.

This implementation strictly adheres to the given context and description.
