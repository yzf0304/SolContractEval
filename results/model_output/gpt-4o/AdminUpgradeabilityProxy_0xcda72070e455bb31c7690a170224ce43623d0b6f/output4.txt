To complete the `UpgradeabilityProxy` contract, we'll implement the missing functions using the provided context. The key functions to implement include `_implementation`, `_upgradeTo`, and `_setImplementation`, which are crucial for managing and updating the logic implementation of the proxy.

Here's the completed `UpgradeabilityProxy` contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.8;

contract UpgradeabilityProxy is Proxy {
    /**
     * @notice Emitted when the implementation is upgraded.
     * @dev This event logs the new implementation address.
     * @param implementation The address of the new implementation.
     */
    event Upgraded(address indexed implementation);

    /**
     * @notice Internal constant for the storage slot used to store the implementation address.
     * @dev This slot is used in the EIP-1967 standard for storing the implementation address.
     */
    bytes32 internal constant IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;

    /**
     * @notice Initializes the proxy with an initial implementation and optionally calls a function on the implementation.
     * @dev The constructor sets the initial implementation and, if provided, forwards the `_data` to the implementation.
     * @param _logic The address of the initial implementation.
     * @param _data Data to be passed to the initial implementation after it is set.
     */
    constructor(address _logic, bytes memory _data) public payable {
        assert(IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT == bytes32(uint256(keccak256('eip1967.proxy.implementation')) - 1));
        _setImplementation(_logic);
        if (_data.length > 0) {
            (bool success, ) = _logic.delegatecall(_data);
            require(success);
        }
    }

    /**
     * @notice Returns the current implementation address.
     * @dev This function reads the implementation address from the storage slot.
     * @return impl The address of the current implementation.
     */
    function _implementation() internal override view returns (address impl) {
        bytes32 slot = IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT;
        assembly {
            impl := sload(slot)
        }
    }

    /**
     * @notice Upgrades the implementation to a new address.
     * @dev This function sets the new implementation and emits the `Upgraded` event.
     * @param newImplementation The address of the new implementation.
     */
    function _upgradeTo(address newImplementation) internal {
        _setImplementation(newImplementation);
        emit Upgraded(newImplementation);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Sets the implementation to a new address.
     * @dev This function ensures the new implementation is a contract and updates the storage slot.
     * @param newImplementation The address of the new implementation.
     */
    function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {
        require(Address.isContract(newImplementation), "UpgradeabilityProxy: new implementation is not a contract");
        bytes32 slot = IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT;
        assembly {
            sstore(slot, newImplementation)
        }
    }

    /**
     * @notice Fallback function to receive Ether.
     * @dev This function allows the contract to receive Ether.
     */
    receive() external payable {}
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`_implementation`**: This function retrieves the implementation address stored in a specific slot using inline assembly for direct access to storage.
  
- **`_upgradeTo`**: This function updates the implementation address to `newImplementation` and emits an `Upgraded` event.

- **`_setImplementation`**: This function first checks that `newImplementation` is a valid contract using `Address.isContract` from the provided library, then sets the implementation address in the designated storage slot using inline assembly.

This contract, using the EIP-1967 standard, allows seamless upgrades of the underlying contract's logic while maintaining persistent state.
