### Explanation of the Implementation:

1. **Mint Functionality**:
   - The `mint()` function calls the `_mint()` internal method inherited from `ERC20`, which increases the total supply and assigns tokens to the specified address.

2. **Burn Functionality**:
   - The `burn()` function calls the `_burn()` internal method inherited from `ERC20`, which reduces the balance of the address and decreases the total supply.

3. **Metadata Updation**:
   - `setName()`, `setSymbol()`, and `setWebsite()` allow the owner to update the name, symbol, and website of the token respectively. These directly modify the internal storage variables `_name`, `_symbol`, and `_website`.

4. **Fallback Functionality**:
   - The `tokenFallback()` function reverts if it's called, ensuring that incoming tokens cannot be handled by this function as per the description.

5. **Take-Out of Tokens**:
   - The `takeOut()` function allows the contract owner to withdraw any ERC20 token (other than the `BOTS` token itself) from the contract by transferring the specified `_amount` to the owner's address.

6. **Restricted Access**:
   - All critical functions (`mint`, `burn`, `setName`, `setSymbol`, `setWebsite`, `takeOut`) are restricted to the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring only the current owner of the contract can call them.

### Adherence to Context & Constraints:
- The contract strictly extends the provided `ERC20` base implementation.
- Follows Solidity 0.7.3 conventions.
- Avoids adding unnecessary contracts or libraries beyond the given context.
- All logic aligns with the given function descriptions and usage.

This implementation fulfills the requirements of the `BOTS` token contract as described.
