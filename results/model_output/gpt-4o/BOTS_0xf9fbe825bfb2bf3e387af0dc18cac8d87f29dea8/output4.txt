### Explanation of Implementation:
1. **Minting Tokens (`mint`):**  
   - Allows the contract owner to mint `_amount` of tokens to a specified `_to` address. This uses the `_mint` function from the parent `ERC20` contract.

2. **Burning Tokens (`burn`):**  
   - Allows the contract owner to burn `_amount` of tokens from a specified `_from` address. This uses the `_burn` function from the parent `ERC20` contract.

3. **Updating Token Name (`setName`) and Symbol (`setSymbol`):**  
   - Provides the ability for the contract owner to update the `_name` and `_symbol` variables. These variables are defined in the parent `ERC20` contract.

4. **Updating Website Metadata (`setWebsite`):**  
   - Adds the ability for the contract owner to update the `_website` variable.

5. **Token Fallback (`tokenFallback`):**  
   - Implements the `tokenFallback` function, which reverts any call to prevent unexpected token transfers.

6. **Token Withdrawal (`takeOut`):**  
   - Allows the contract owner to withdraw tokens of any ERC20 type from the contract's balance to their own address.

### Notes:
- The provided implementation strictly adheres to the provided description and the base contract structures.
- The contract was written with Solidity 0.7.3 in mind, ensuring compatibility with its syntax and features.
