Here's the completed **BotMinting** contract implementation strictly based on the provided context and description. The contract adheres to Solidity version 0.4.20 and avoids introducing unrelated code, dependencies, or examples.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice This contract is responsible for minting and auctioning bots. It extends the BotAuction contract.
 * @dev The contract handles the creation of promo and Gen0 bots, and manages their limits and auction prices.
 */
contract BotMinting is BotAuction {

    uint256 public constant PROMO_CREATION_LIMIT = 5000;

    uint256 public constant GEN0_CREATION_LIMIT = 45000;

    uint256 public constant GEN0_STARTING_PRICE = 10 finney;

    uint256 public constant GEN0_AUCTION_DURATION = 1 days;

    uint256 public promoCreatedCount;

    uint256 public gen0CreatedCount;

    /**
     * @notice Creates a promo bot with the specified genes and assigns it to an owner.
     * @dev Only the COO can call this function. The bot owner defaults to the COO if not specified.
     * @param _genes The genetic makeup of the bot.
     * @param _owner The address of the owner of the new bot.
     */
    function createPromoBot(uint256 _genes, address _owner) external onlyCOO {
        require(promoCreatedCount < PROMO_CREATION_LIMIT);
        
        address botOwner = _owner;
        if (botOwner == address(0)) {
            botOwner = cooAddress;
        }

        promoCreatedCount++;
        _createBot(0, 0, 0, _genes, botOwner);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Creates a Gen0 bot with the specified genes and starts an auction for it.
     * @dev Only the COO can call this function. The bot is initially owned by the contract and then put up for auction.
     * @param _genes The genetic makeup of the bot.
     */
    function createGen0Auction(uint256 _genes) external onlyCOO {
        require(gen0CreatedCount < GEN0_CREATION_LIMIT);

        uint256 botId = _createBot(0, 0, 0, _genes, address(this));
        gen0CreatedCount++;

        saleAuction.createAuction(
            botId,
            _computeNextGen0Price(),
            0,
            GEN0_AUCTION_DURATION,
            address(this)
        );
    }

    /**
     * @notice Computes the next price for a Gen0 bot based on the average sale price.
     * @dev The price is calculated as the average sale price plus half of the average sale price. If the computed price is below the starting price, it defaults to the starting price.
     * @return The next price for a Gen0 bot.
     */
    function _computeNextGen0Price() internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 averagePrice = saleAuction.averageGen0SalePrice();
        uint256 nextPrice = averagePrice + (averagePrice / 2);

        if (nextPrice < GEN0_STARTING_PRICE) {
            nextPrice = GEN0_STARTING_PRICE;
        }

        return nextPrice;
    }
}
```

### Key Features:
1. **Promo Bots:**
   - `createPromoBot` allows the COO to create promo bots.
   - Promo bot creation is capped at `PROMO_CREATION_LIMIT`.
   - Ownership defaults to the COO if no owner is specified.

2. **Gen0 Bots and Auctions:**
   - `createGen0Auction` creates a Gen0 bot and starts an auction for it.
   - Gen0 bot creation is capped at `GEN0_CREATION_LIMIT`.
   - The starting price of the auction is determined by `_computeNextGen0Price`.

3. **Price Calculation:**
   - `_computeNextGen0Price` computes the price for Gen0 bots using the average sale price (`averageGen0SalePrice`).
   - Ensures the price doesn't drop below `GEN0_STARTING_PRICE`.

### Solidity Version Compatibility:
This contract is compatible with Solidity version `0.4.20`, with careful consideration for older language features. For example:
- Usage of `now` for the current timestamp.
- Avoidance of modern features (e.g., `emit` for events).
