Here's the completed implementation of the `Collection` contract, strictly adhering to the provided context and descriptions. I will ensure that all functions are implemented functionally correct while retaining ownership validation and creator checks:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.17;

contract Collection is Ownable {
    
    // Address of the contract creator
    address createAddress;
    
    // Address of the TRB token contract (hardcoded)
    address trbAddress = 0x0Ba45A8b5d5575935B8158a88C631E9F9C95a2e5;
    
    // TRB interface instance
    TrbInterface trbContract = TrbInterface(trbAddress);
    
    /**

    }

        require(msg.sender == createAddress, "Collection: Caller is not the creator");
    }
    
    /**

     * @dev Verifies that the caller is the contract creator.
     */
    function finalize() external onlyOwner payable {
        require(msg.sender == createAddress, "Collection: Caller is not the creator");
        selfdestruct(msg.sender);
    }

     */
    function getCreate() public view returns (address) {
        return createAddress;

    function depositStake() external onlyOwner payable {
        require(msg.sender == createAddress, "Collection: Caller is not the creator");
        trbContract.depositStake();
    }
    
    /**

    function submitMiningSolution(

        uint256[5] calldata _value
    ) external onlyOwner payable {
        require(createAddress == msg.sender, "Collection: Caller is not the creator");
        
        // Gas check and validation
        if (gasleft() <= 10**6) {
            bytes32 slotProgress = 0x6c505cb2db6644f57b42d87bd9407b0f66788b07d0617a2bc1356a0e69e66f9a;

    function getUintVar(bytes32 _data) public onlyOwner view returns (uint256) {
        require(msg.sender == createAddress, "Collection: Caller is not the creator");
        return trbContract.getUintVar(_data);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Ownership Checks**: The functions utilize `onlyOwner` modifiers to restrict access to the contract owner. Additional `createAddress` checks ensure the caller is the original deployer.
2. **Interaction with TRB Token Contract**: The `TrbInterface` is used to interact with the TRB token contract for operations like staking, withdrawing, tipping, and mining solutions.
3. **Error Handling**: Proper checks are in place to ensure sufficient ether balance (`withdrawEth`) and successful TRB transfers (`withdrawTrb`).
4. **Gas Validation**: The `submitMiningSolution` function verifies gas availability and mining progress using the provided logic.

This implementation strictly follows the given context and ensures robustness.
