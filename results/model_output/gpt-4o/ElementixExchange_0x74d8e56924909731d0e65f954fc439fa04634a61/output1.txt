### Explanation of the Key Parts:

1. **`startGrantAuthentication`:**
   - This function begins the process of granting permissions to an address. The address is added to the `pending` mapping with the current timestamp.

2. **`endGrantAuthentication`:**
   - This function completes the grant process, allowing access to the specified address after the delay period (`DELAY_PERIOD` = 7 days). It ensures that enough time has elapsed since the `startGrantAuthentication` call.

3. **`revokeAuthentication`:**
   - This function revokes access for an authenticated address instantly by setting its value in the `contracts` mapping to `false`.

4. **`registerProxy`:**
   - Allows users to register their own `OwnableDelegateProxy` contracts. Each user can register only one proxy. The new proxy is stored in the `proxies` mapping.

5. **`OwnableDelegateProxy`:**
   - A proxy contract that links a specific owner (the user registering the proxy) to a delegate proxy implementation (`delegateProxyImplementation`).

6. **Events:**
   - `RegisterProxy`: Emitted when a user registers a new proxy.
   - `AuthenticationOperation`: Emitted during authentication or revocation processes to signal state changes.

This implementation adheres strictly to the provided context and guidelines. It avoids introducing unnecessary dependencies or unrelated logic, ensuring clarity and maintainability.
