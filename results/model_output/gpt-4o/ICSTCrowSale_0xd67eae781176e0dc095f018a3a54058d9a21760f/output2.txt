### Key Implementation Notes:
1. **SafeMath Usage:** All mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) utilize the SafeMath library to ensure safety against overflow or underflow.
2. **Access Control:** Functions that modify state or involve sensitive actions are restricted to the owner using the `onlyOwner` modifier.
3. **Validation:** Functions include proper validations (e.g., ensuring sufficient token balance, valid parameters) to prevent misuse or errors.
4. **Gas Optimization:** Loops in the `airdrop` function are designed to process multiple addresses without unnecessary complexity, though caution should be taken with large arrays to avoid exceeding the gas limit.
