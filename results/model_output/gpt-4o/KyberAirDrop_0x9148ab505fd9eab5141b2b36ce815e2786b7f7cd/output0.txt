Below is the implementation of the `KyberGenesisToken` contract, completed based on the context provided and the described specifications. It adheres to Solidity version 0.4.15 and avoids introducing any new contracts.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Minting**: Ensures each recipient receives only one token, maintaining the fixed supply mechanism.
2. **Burning**: Requires the caller to hold exactly one token before burning.
3. **Ownership Transfer**: Handles ownership transfer to null address at the end of minting.
4. **Emergency ERC20 Drain**: Drains accidentally sent tokens to a secure, hardcoded multisig address.
5. **ERC20 Stubs**: Reverts unsupported ERC20 methods while adhering to the ERC20 interface.

This implementation strictly follows the provided context and description without introducing any new contracts.
