### Explanation of the implemented functions:

- **`listAddress`**:
  Allows the owner to set a contribution cap for a single address. A cap of `0` delists the address. The function emits the `ListAddress` event to log the details.

- **`listAddresses`**:
  Enables batch processing for listing multiple addresses with their respective caps in one transaction. Ensures the array lengths match before processing.

- **`setSlackUsersCap`**:
  Updates the global "slack user's cap". Addresses with a cap value of `1` will use this global cap.

- **`getCap`**:
  Returns the contribution cap for a given address. If the cap is `1`, it returns the global `slackUsersCap`; otherwise, it retrieves the cap directly from the `addressCap` mapping.

- **`destroy`**:
  Allows the contract owner to destroy the contract and send any funds held by the contract to the `owner`.

This implementation strictly adheres to the given context and contract description without introducing any new contracts or logic.
