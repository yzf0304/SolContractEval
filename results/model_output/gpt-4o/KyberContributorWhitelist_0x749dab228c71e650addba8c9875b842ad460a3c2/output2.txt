### Explanation:
1. **Constructor**: The constructor initializes the contract but performs no additional initialization, adhering to the requirements.
2. **Event `ListAddress`**: Emits an event whenever an address is added or updated in the whitelist.
3. **`listAddress` Function**: Allows the owner to add or update individual contributor addresses with specific caps.
4. **`listAddresses` Function**: Allows batch operations for setting multiple addresses with respective caps, improving efficiency.
5. **`setSlackUsersCap` Function**: Sets the `slackUsersCap`, a global cap applied to addresses with a cap value of 1.
6. **`getCap` Function**: Returns the cap for a given address. If the cap is 1, it uses `slackUsersCap`.
7. **`destroy` Function**: Enables the owner to destroy the contract and reclaim funds safely.

This implementation strictly adheres to the provided context and description. The contract is compliant with Solidity version 0.4.13.
