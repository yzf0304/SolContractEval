### Explanation:
1. **Inheritance**: `KyberContributorWhitelist` inherits from `Ownable`, granting the `onlyOwner` modifier for access control.
2. **Mapping**: `addressCap` stores individual caps for each address, while `slackUsersCap` is the cap for users with a value of 1.
3. **Events**: `ListAddress` is emitted whenever an address is listed or updated with a cap.
4. **Owner Controls**:
   - `listAddress`: Allows the owner to set or update an individual cap.
   - `listAddresses`: Batch operation for setting multiple caps.
   - `setSlackUsersCap`: Updates the global cap for addresses with a value of 1.
   - `destroy`: Allows the owner to self-destruct the contract and recover any remaining funds.
5. **Cap Retrieval**: `getCap` checks if the user has a specific cap or falls under the slack cap.
6. **Version**: Compatible with Solidity 0.4.13.
