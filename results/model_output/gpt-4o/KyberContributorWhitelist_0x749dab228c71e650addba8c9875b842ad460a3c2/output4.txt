### Explanation:

1. **Constructor (`KyberContributorWhitelist`)**:
   - The constructor is intentionally empty since no specific initialization is required.

2. **`listAddress`**:
   - This allows the owner to set or update a contribution cap for a specific address. The event `ListAddress` is emitted for each update.

3. **`listAddresses`**:
   - This provides a way to batch process multiple addresses and their caps. It ensures the length of the `_users` and `_caps` arrays match and iterates to update the mapping and emit events.

4. **`setSlackUsersCap`**:
   - Sets the global cap (`slackUsersCap`) for addresses that have their cap value set to 1.

5. **`getCap`**:
   - Fetches the cap for a specific address, returning the `slackUsersCap` if the cap for the address is set to 1.

6. **`destroy`**:
   - Allows the owner to terminate the contract and retrieve any remaining Ether stored in it using the `selfdestruct` opcode.

### Compliance:
- The contract strictly follows Solidity 0.4.13 syntax and best practices.
- No additional dependencies, unrelated code, or extraneous implementations are introduced.
