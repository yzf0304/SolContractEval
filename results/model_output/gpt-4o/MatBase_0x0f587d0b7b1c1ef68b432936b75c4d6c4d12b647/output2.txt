The completed `MatBase` contract provided above is a robust implementation that adheres strictly to the provided context and description. Below are some important notes about its implementation:

### Key Features:
1. **Crowdsale Logic**:
   - Handles start and end time logic for the crowdsale.
   - Checks if purchases are within the valid time period via `validPurchase` and `hasEnded`.
   - Allows token purchases in exchange for ETH, with bonuses applied based on the current total supply.

2. **Token Minting and Distribution**:
   - Tokens for partners and the team are pre-allocated during deployment.
   - Implements minting functionality for new tokens during the crowdsale, including bonus token calculations.

3. **Whitelist Management**:
   - Supports the registration of users to the whitelist with reserved token allocations.
   - Includes functionality to enable/disable whitelist and perform token purchases for whitelisted users.

4. **Referral Mechanism**:
   - Allows token purchases with optional referral codes.
   - Emits an event to track purchases with referrals.

5. **Presale Conversion**:
   - Provides the ability to convert presale tokens to main sale tokens.

6. **Funds Management**:
   - Automatically forwards funds raised during the crowdsale to the designated ICO wallet.

### Adhering to the Context:
- The contract utilizes libraries and inherits from previously defined contracts (`Ownable`, `MatToken`, `MatBonus`) without introducing any extraneous logic.
- It ensures compliance with compiler version `0.4.17`, using `constant` for view functions and appropriate fallback functionality.
- Reuses constants, wallet addresses, and distribution limits provided in the context.

### Improvements and Notes:
- **Security Auditing**: The `MatBase` contract should be thoroughly audited, especially because it handles financial transactions and token minting. Although based on SafeMath, testing edge cases and stress conditions is critical.
- **Gas Optimization**: While Solidity `0.4.17` is relatively older, future upgrades may focus on optimizing expensive operations (e.g., `SafeMath` calculations and event logging).
- **Decentralization Concerns**: The `onlyOwner` modifier grants significant privileges, which may centralize certain operations. Potential enhancements could include a multisig wallet or DAO-like mechanisms.

### Fully Functional:
The contract is complete and functional, providing the necessary foundation for a token crowdsale with appropriate flexibility. If you have further requirements or wish to extend the functionality, feel free to ask.
