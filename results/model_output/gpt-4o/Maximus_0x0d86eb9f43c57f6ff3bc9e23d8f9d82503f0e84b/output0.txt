### Key Notes:
1. **Simplifications:**
   - No penalties, rewards, or complex ending behavior for stakes is implemented.
2. **Emulated `currentDay`:**
   - The contract uses block timestamps divided by 1 day to determine the current day relative to the launch day.
3. **Basic ERC20-style balances and allowances:** 
   - Uses mappings for tracking allowances and token balances.

This implementation follows the provided description strictly and avoids introducing other contracts or features.
