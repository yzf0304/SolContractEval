Certainly! Based on the provided context and requirements for the `HEXToken` smart contract, here is a basic implementation that captures the intended functionalities such as staking, transferring, and approval of HEX tokens, while providing auxiliary functions like `currentDay` and `stakeCount`.

Please note that this implementation is intended for educational purposes and may require further security reviews and feature enhancements before deploying on a production environment.

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Staking Mechanism**:
   - Users can initiate a stake with a specified amount of HEX and duration using `stakeStart`.
   - `stakeEnd` allows users to end a stake after its duration, returning the tokens to their balance.

2. **Token Transfer and Approval**:
   - `transfer` allows HEX tokens to be sent to another address.
   - `approve` sets an allowance for another address to spend tokens on behalf of the user.

3. **Auxiliary Functions**:
   - `currentDay` calculates the current day since the contract's launch.
   - `stakeCount` returns the number of stakes for a specified address.

This code provides a framework for handling basic token operations and a staking feature, following typical patterns found in staking smart contracts. Be sure to conduct thorough testing and consider additional safety features for production use.
