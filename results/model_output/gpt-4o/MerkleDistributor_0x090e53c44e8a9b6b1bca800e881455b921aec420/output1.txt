### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The contract is initialized with the `token` address and the `merkleRoot` which is immutable.
   - These two values are set in the constructor.

2. **Claim Tracking**:
   - A packed array of booleans (`claimedBitMap`) is used to track which indices in the Merkle tree have been claimed.
   - Each index is mapped to a specific bit in a `uint256` slot.

3. **Merkle Proof Verification**:
   - The `claim` function verifies the Merkle proof provided by the user, ensuring the claim is valid.
   - It computes the Merkle tree node using the provided inputs (`index`, `account`, `amount`) and checks it against the `merkleRoot`.

4. **Claim Execution**:
   - Once the claim is verified, the index is marked as claimed using the `_setClaimed` function.
   - The specified `amount` of tokens is transferred to the `account` using the ERC20 `transfer` function.

5. **Events**:
   - The contract emits a `Claimed` event whenever a claim is successfully executed.

6. **Strict Solidity Version**:
   - The contract is written for Solidity version `0.6.11` as per the requirement.

7. **No Unrelated Code**:
   - The implementation strictly adheres to the provided interface and description without introducing unnecessary dependencies or functionalities.

This contract is now complete and functional for deployment.
