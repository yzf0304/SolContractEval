### Key Notes:
1. **SafeMath Utilization**: Used `SafeMath` for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows/underflows.
2. **Strict Validation**: Ensured proper input validation for addresses, values, and payment IDs.
3. **Functionality**: Implemented all specified features as described, maintaining the behavior strictly according to the context provided.
4. **Compatibility**: The contract is designed for Solidity version 0.5.10.
