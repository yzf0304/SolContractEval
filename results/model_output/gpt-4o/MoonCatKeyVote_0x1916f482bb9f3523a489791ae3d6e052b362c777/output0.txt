### Explanation:

1. **Voting Workflow**:
   - `startVote()`: Starts the vote by setting the vote timestamp.
   - `cancelVote()`: Cancels the vote, making it inaccessible.
   - `submitVote()`: Submits a vote after verifying voter eligibility through a Merkle proof.
   - `getResult()`: Returns the result of the vote after it has ended.

2. **Merkle Proof Verification**:
   - `submitVote()` uses `verifyMerkleProof()` to validate whether the voter's `msg.sender` is part of the Merkle tree (i.e., eligible to vote).

3. **Modifiers**:
   - Modifiers ensure the vote is either in the appropriate state (Pending, Active, Complete) or restricted to the owner.

4. **State Variables**:
   - `yesVotes` and `noVotes` are counters for votes.
   - `hasVoted` prevents multiple voting by the same address.
