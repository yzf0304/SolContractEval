### Key Points About the Implementation
1. **FoundationAccountNeedFreezeOneYear Modifier**: Used in the `transfer` function to restrict transfers by the foundation account until the freeze period expires.
2. **ERC20 Compliance**:
   - `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, `allowance` implemented per the ERC20 standard.
   - Events `Transfer` and `Approval` emitted as required by ERC20.
3. **approveAndCall**: Extends functionality for contracts requiring notification or data upon approval.
4. **Safety Measures**: Includes checks for zero address transfers, overflows, and allowance updates.

This contract is compatible with Solidity 0.4.18 and provides the requested features without introducing extraneous or unrelated functionality.
