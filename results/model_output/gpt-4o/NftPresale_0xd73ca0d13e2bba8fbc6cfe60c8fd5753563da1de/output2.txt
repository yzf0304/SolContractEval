### Key Features
1. **Presale Timing**: Ensures that purchases can only be made between `START_TIME` and `FINISH_TIME`.
2. **Unique Buyers**: Tracks buyers to prevent multiple purchases by the same address.
3. **Signature Verification**: Utilizes `ecrecover` to validate the signature provided with each purchase.
4. **Ownership Control**: Only the contract owner can withdraw funds.
5. **Prefixed Hash**: Adds the standard Ethereum signed message prefix for signature recovery.

### Testing Considerations
- Ensure the signature matches the `verifyAddress`.
- Test edge cases for presale start and finish times.
- Verify functionality for minting NFTs and withdrawal of funds.
