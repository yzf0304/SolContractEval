### Key Points:
1. **Presale Time**: The contract enforces the presale window using `START_TIME` and `FINISH_TIME`.
2. **Signature Validation**: The signature is validated using `verify` and `recoverSigner`, ensuring only authorized buyers can participate.
3. **Purchase Limit**: Each user can buy only one NFT during the presale, enforced via the `buyers` mapping.
4. **CashOut**: The owner can withdraw all ETH from the contract to the specified address.
5. **Security**: The contract uses `require` statements for validation and proper error handling.

### Notes:
- All specified context has been followed.
- The contract is functional and adheres to Solidity 0.8.7, which includes built-in overflow/underflow protection.
- Ensure `verifyAddress` has signed the relevant messages for whitelist users.
