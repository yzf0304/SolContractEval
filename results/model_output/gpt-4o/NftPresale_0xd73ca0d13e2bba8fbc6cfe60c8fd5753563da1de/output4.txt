### Key Features
1. **Presale Time Restriction**: Enforces start and end times for the presale.
2. **Payment Validation**: Checks the exact payment amount.
3. **Signature Verification**: Ensures only authorized purchases using `ecrecover`.
4. **Single Purchase Limit**: Prevents multiple purchases by the same user.
5. **NFT Minting**: Integrates with the NFT contract for token minting.
6. **Withdraw Funds**: Owner can withdraw the collected ETH.

### Testing Checklist
- Deploy the contract with the correct NFT and receiver addresses.
- Ensure buyers can purchase only one NFT during the presale period.
- Validate signature functionality.
- Confirm that funds are withdrawable by the owner.
