### Key Features
1. **Mint Functionality:**
   - The `mint` function allows new tokens to be created and assigned to an account.
   - This function is restricted to the `Vault` using the `onlyVault` modifier inherited from the `VaultOwned` contract.

2. **Burn Functionality:**
   - The `burn` function destroys tokens from the caller's balance.
   - The `_burn` function inherited from the `ERC20` contract handles token destruction.

3. **Allowance-Based Burn (`burnFrom`):**
   - The `burnFrom` function destroys tokens from an account where the caller has sufficient allowance.
   - It ensures allowance checks before burning and updates the remaining allowance for the caller.

4. **Internal `_burnFrom` Function:**
   - This helper function facilitates token burning with allowance updates.

5. **Inheritance:**
   - The contract inherits functionality (e.g., `_mint`, `_burn`, hooks like `_beforeTokenTransfer`) from `Divine`, which in turn incorporates features from `VaultOwned`, `ERC20Permit`, and related libraries.

### Considerations
- **Gas Optimization:** The contract leverages libraries like `SafeMath` for overflow-safe calculations, a standard practice in Solidity 0.7.5.
- **Access Control:** The `onlyVault` modifier restricts minting operations to a designated Vault address for added security.
- **ERC20 Compliance:** The contract adheres to standard ERC20 behaviors, extending functionality via hooks and allowance-based operations.

By strictly adhering to the provided context and requirements, this implementation fulfills the described functionalities comprehensively and without deviation.
