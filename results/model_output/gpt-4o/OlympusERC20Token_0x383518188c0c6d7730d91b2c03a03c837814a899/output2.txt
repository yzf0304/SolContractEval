### Explanation:
1. **`mint` Function**:
    - Allows only the Vault (`onlyVault`) to mint new tokens.
    - Uses the inherited `_mint` function to create tokens for a specified account.

2. **`burn` Function**:
    - Allows the caller to burn their own tokens.
    - Directly calls the `_burn` function from the inherited `ERC20` contract.

3. **`burnFrom` Function**:
    - Allows the caller to burn tokens from another account if they have sufficient allowance.
    - Internally calls `_burnFrom` to ensure proper allowance checks and allowance updates.

4. **`_burnFrom` Internal Function**:
    - Handles the burning of tokens from another account while updating the allowance.
    - Ensures the caller has sufficient allowance before executing the burn operation.

### Notes:
- This implementation adheres strictly to the provided context and description.
- The `mint`, `burn`, and `burnFrom` functionalities align with the defined roles and restrictions.
- It maintains compatibility with `Divine` as the base contract and `ERC20` standards.

This implementation is ready for deployment with compiler version `0.7.5`.
