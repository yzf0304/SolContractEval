Here is the completed implementation of the `PSP` smart contract strictly adhering to the provided context, description, and requirements:

 * @notice This contract implements the ERC-20 standard with additional features such as minting, delegation, and voting.
 * @dev The contract includes functionalities for token management, minting, and voting. It also supports EIP-712 for secure off-chain approvals.
