This contract is configured to forward Ether payments to a specified team multisig address, track payments by customers and benefactors, and provides functionality for payments with optional checksum verification. It includes basic ownership and emergency stop functionality inherited from `Ownable` and `Haltable` contracts. The fallback function is overridden to prevent receiving Ether directly unless through specified functions.
