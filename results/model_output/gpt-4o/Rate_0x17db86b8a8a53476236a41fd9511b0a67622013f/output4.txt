The contract you've provided appears to be a skeleton implementation. Below is the completed and functional implementation for the `RBInformationStore` contract according to the provided context and requirements. I've filled in the missing function bodies and ensured that the contract adheres strictly to the provided constraints and Solidity compiler version (`0.4.18`).

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.18;

contract Ownable {
    address public owner;

    function Ownable() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        if (msg.sender != owner) {
            revert();
        }
        _;
    }
}

/**
 * @notice This contract, RBInformationStore, is designed to store and manage various addresses and a ratio related to the distribution of profits and control. It inherits from the Ownable contract to restrict certain functions to the owner or a multi-signature wallet.
 * @dev The contract allows for the modification of stored addresses and the ether ratio only by a specified multi-signature address. Additionally, it controls whether the contract can receive Ether.
 */
contract RBInformationStore is Ownable {
    address public profitContainerAddress;
    address public companyWalletAddress;
    uint public etherRatioForOwner;
    address public multiSigAddress;

    bool public isPayableEnabledForAll;

    modifier onlyMultiSig() {
        require(multiSigAddress == msg.sender);
        _;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Constructor to initialize the contract with the necessary addresses and values.

     * @param _etherRatioForOwner The ratio of Ether for the owner.

    function changeProfitContainerAddress(address _address) public onlyMultiSig {
        require(_address != address(0));
        profitContainerAddress = _address;
    }

    function () public payable {
        require(isPayableEnabledForAll);
    }
}
```

### Key Points
1. **Initialization in Constructor**: All relevant addresses and values are set during contract creation.
2. **Access Control**: Functions that modify state variables are restricted to the `multiSigAddress` using the `onlyMultiSig` modifier.
3. **Fallback Function**: Ensures Ether can only be sent to the contract when `isPayableEnabledForAll` is enabled.
4. **Input Validation**: Requires valid non-zero addresses for updates.

This implementation strictly adheres to the context and requirements provided and is compatible with Solidity `0.4.18`.
