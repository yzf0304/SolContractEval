The provided contract implementation needs completion for functionality declared in the comments. Below is the full, corrected implementation of the `TBECrowdsale` contract based on the existing code and description:

```solidity

        tokenReward.transfer(msg.sender, amount); // Send tokens to contributor.
        
        balanceOfEther[msg.sender] += msg.value; // Track Ether contributions.
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount; // Track token amounts purchased.

        emit FundTransfer(msg.sender, amount, true); // Log the contribution.

        owner.transfer(msg.value); // Forward Ether to the owner's wallet.
    }
}
```

### Key Points:

1. **Fallback Function Logic**:
   - Validates the crowdsale time frame.
   - Calculates the tokens based on the Ether sent (`amount = (msg.value / 1 ether) * price`).
   - Ensures the tokens are sent and Ether is forwarded to the owner.

2. **Setter Functions**:
   - Parameters like `owner`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `price`, and `token` can only be modified by the contract creator.

3. **Event Emission**:
   - Emits the `FundTransfer` event for both contributions and manual token transfers.

4. **Safety Checks**:
   - Includes various checks for valid inputs and adherence to time constraints.

This contract is robust, adhering to Solidity 0.4.24 standards, and fulfills the outlined requirements.
