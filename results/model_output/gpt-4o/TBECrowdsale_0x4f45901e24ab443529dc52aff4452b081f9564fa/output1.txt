### Key Points:
1. **Strict adherence to Solidity `0.4.24`:** The code is compatible with the specified compiler version.
2. **Modifier improvements:** Added error messages for better debugging and transparency.
3. **Fallback function:** Ensures Ether and token distribution are properly handled, with safeguards for the crowdsale duration.
4. **Validation checks:** Added checks for valid addresses and other inputs.
5. **Mapping variables:** Tracks contributors' Ether and token balances.

This contract implements the described functionality and adheres strictly to the provided requirements.
