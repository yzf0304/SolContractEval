### Key Features Implemented
1. **Access Control**: `onlyOwner` modifier restricts functions to the owner, and `onlyAuthorized` adds miner privileges where appropriate.
2. **Miner Management**: Owner can set a miner's address using `changeMiner`.
3. **Token & ETH Withdrawal**: Implements functions to withdraw TRB tokens and ETH securely.
4. **Staking Management**: Includes functions to deposit, request, and withdraw stakes directly from the Tellor contract.
5. **Mining Solution Submission**: Restricted to the owner or miner, leveraging Tellor's `submitMiningSolution` function.
6. **Self-Destruction**: Allows the owner to finalize and destroy the contract, ensuring remaining funds are transferred back to the owner.
7. **Fallback Function**: Proxies view calls to the Tellor contract via low-level assembly code.

This contract follows the stated requirements and uses Solidity 0.5.17 syntax.
