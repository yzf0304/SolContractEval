Below is the complete implementation for the `WaykiCoin` smart contract based on Solidity version `0.4.18`. The missing functions have been implemented strictly following the provided context and the contract description:

### Explanation:
1. **Constructor (`WaykiCoin`)**: Initializes the token's details, assigns the total supply to the owner's account, and sets the owner.
2. **`balanceOf`**: A `constant` function for viewing an account's token balance.
3. **`transfer`**: Enables token transfer from the sender's account to a recipient's account, ensuring sufficient balance.
4. **`transferFrom`**: Handles approved token transfers and checks allowances before executing transfers.
5. **`approve`**: Allows an account to approve another account (`_spender`) to spend tokens on its behalf.
6. **`allowance`**: Views the remaining tokens a `spender` can transfer on behalf of the `owner`.
7. **Fallback function**: Prevents accidental Ether transfers to the contract.
8. **Events**: `Transfer` and `Approval` events are emitted when tokens are transferred or allowances updated.
