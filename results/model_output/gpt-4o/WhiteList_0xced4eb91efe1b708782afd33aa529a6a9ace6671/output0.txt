The `WhiteList` smart contract you provided inherits from the `Ownable` contract and implements functionality to manage a list of whitelisted addresses. It allows the owner of the contract to add or remove addresses from the whitelist, as well as check the whitelist status of a particular address. Below are some key aspects of the implementation:

### Key Points:
1. **Inheritance**: The `WhiteList` contract inherits from the `Ownable` contract, making use of the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict access to certain functions (actions only the owner can perform).

2. **Mapping**: The `whiteList` mapping tracks whether an address is whitelisted (`true`) or not (`false`).

3. **Total Count**: The `totalWhiteListed` variable keeps track of the total number of whitelisted addresses.

4. **Events**: Various events (`LogWhiteListed`, `LogWhiteListedMultiple`, `LogRemoveWhiteListed`) are emitted to log key changes to the whitelist for transparency and off-chain monitoring.

5. **Functions**:
   - `isWhiteListed(address)`: Allows anyone to check if a given address is currently whitelisted.
   - `addToWhiteList(address)`: Allows the owner to add a single address to the whitelist.
   - `addToWhiteListMultiple(address[])`: Allows the owner to add multiple addresses to the whitelist at once.
   - `removeFromWhiteList(address)`: Allows the owner to remove an address from the whitelist.

### Solidity Code Notes:
The code adheres to compiler version 0.4.18. Here are a few points to ensure compatibility and correctness:
- Declared the constructor for `Ownable` as a function named `Ownable()` (constructor syntax in Solidity 0.4.x).
- Used `require` to ensure conditions (e.g., checking if an address is already whitelisted or not) are met before proceeding with state modifications.

The `WhiteList` contract implementation is clean and straightforward, adhering to the provided context and requirements. However, here are some minor enhancements or considerations:
   
### Suggestions to Improve or Extend:
1. **Gas Optimization**: In the `addToWhiteListMultiple` function, the cost increases linearly with the number of addresses provided. Batch operations should only be used with small lists to avoid exceeding the gas limit.

2. **Protect Against Zero Addresses**:
   - Currently, it’s possible to whitelist or remove the zero address (`0x0`). Adding a check like `require(_user != address(0));` in `addToWhiteList` and `removeFromWhiteList` ensures logical correctness.

3. **Event Visibility**:
   - Events have been used effectively, but it’s important to include detailed information (e.g., an array of added addresses in `LogWhiteListedMultiple`) when applicable to enhance traceability.

4. **Upgrade Compiler and Patterns**:
   - For Solidity >= 0.8.x, the syntax has evolved (e.g., using `constructor` explicitly) and includes built-in overflow/underflow checks. If possible, consider upgrading to a newer version of Solidity in future iterations to leverage these features.

5. **Ownership Transfer Safety**:
   - The `transferOwnership` function has already been implemented in the `Ownable` base contract, but care should be taken with ownership to avoid accidental loss of contract control. Always test ownership transfers on testnets before deploying to production.

Overall, this contract is a valid implementation of a whitelist managed by an owner account. Let me know if further extensions or customizations are needed!
