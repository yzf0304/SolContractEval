Below is the completed OlympusERC20Token contract. It strictly follows the provided skeleton, uses only the existing base contracts and libraries, and adds only the three required external/public functions plus their internal logic.

```

Notes:

- `mint` is gated by `onlyVault()`, as required.
- `burn` simply burns the callerâ€™s tokens.
- `burnFrom` delegates to `_burnFrom`, which checks and reduces allowance before burning.
- No other functions or dependencies were introduced.
