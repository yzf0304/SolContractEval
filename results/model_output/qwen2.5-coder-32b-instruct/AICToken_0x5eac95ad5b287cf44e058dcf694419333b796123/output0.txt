Below is the completed `BasicToken` contract implementing the `ERC20Basic` interface and using `SafeMath` for safe arithmetic operations. This contract is designed to be compatible with Solidity version 0.4.25.

```solidity
/**
 * @title BasicToken
 * @dev Very simple ERC20 Token example, where all tokens are pre-assigned to the creator.
 * Note they can later distribute these tokens as they wish using `transfer` and other
 * `ERC20` functions.

```

### Key Points:
- **Constructor**: Initializes the total supply and assigns all tokens to the contract deployer.
- **totalSupply()**: Returns the total number of tokens in existence.
- **balanceOf(address _owner)**: Returns the balance of the specified address.
- **transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)**: Transfers tokens from the caller's address to `_to`. Ensures no transfer to the zero address and sufficient balance.
- **msgSender()**: Utility function to return the `msg.sender`.
- **_preValidateTransfer()**: Placeholder for additional validation logic before a transfer occurs (currently does nothing).

This contract adheres to the requirements specified in the context and description, ensuring compatibility with Solidity version 0.4.25.
