Here is the completed `BasicToken` contract based on the provided descriptions and ensuring compatibility with Solidity compiler version 0.4.25:

```solidity
/**
 * @title BasicToken
 * @dev Very simple ERC20 Token example, where all tokens are pre-assigned to the creator.
 * Note they can later distribute these tokens as they wish using `transfer` and other
 * `ERC20` functions.
 */

    using SafeMath for uint256;

    mapping(address => uint256) balances;

     * that the recipient is not the zero address, the recipient is not the sender, and the sender has

```

### Key Points:
- The contract initializes with an `initialSupply` of tokens assigned to the contract creator.
- Uses `SafeMath` for safe arithmetic operations.
- Implements all required functions from `ERC20Basic`.
- `_preValidateTransfer` includes checks to prevent self-transfer and ensure the recipient is not the zero address.
- Includes an additional constructor to initialize the token supply and assigns it to the deploying address.
