Below is the complete implementation of the `BasicToken` contract based on the provided description and context, targeting Solidity version 0.4.25:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.25;

/**
 * @title BasicToken
 * @dev Very simple ERC20 Token example, where all tokens are pre-assigned to the creator.
 * Note they can later distribute these tokens as they wish using `transfer` and other
 * `ERC20` functions.
 */
contract BasicToken is ERC20Basic {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    mapping(address => uint256) balances;

    uint256 totalSupply_;

    /**
     * @notice Constructor to initialize the token with a given supply assigned to the creator.
     * @param _initialSupply The initial amount of tokens to be minted and assigned to the creator.
     */
    function BasicToken(uint256 _initialSupply) public {
        totalSupply_ = _initialSupply;
        balances[msg.sender] = _initialSupply;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Returns the total token supply.
     * @dev This function returns the total number of tokens in existence.
     * @return The total supply of tokens.
     */
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
        return totalSupply_;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Returns the address of the message sender.
     * @dev This function is a utility function that returns the address of the message sender.
     * @return The address of the message sender.
     */
    function msgSender() 
        public
        view
        returns (address)
    {
        return msg.sender;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Transfers a specified amount of tokens from the message sender to a specified recipient.
     * @dev This function transfers tokens from the message sender to a specified recipient. It ensures
     * that the recipient is not the zero address, the recipient is not the sender, and the sender has
     * sufficient balance. It also calls `_preValidateTransfer` for additional validation before
     * updating the balances and emitting the `Transfer` event.
     * @param _to The address of the recipient.
     * @param _value The amount of tokens to transfer.
     * @return A boolean value indicating whether the transfer was successful.
     */
    function transfer(
        address _to, 
        uint256 _value

        balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Returns the token balance of a specified address.
     * @dev This function returns the token balance of a specified address.
     * @param _owner The address to query the balance of.

     */
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256) {

    }

    /**

     */
    function _preValidateTransfer(
        address _from, 
        address _to, 
        uint256 _value
    ) 
        internal 
    {
        require(_from != _to);  // Assuming additional check that sender and recipient cannot be the same
        // Add more validations here if needed
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Constructor**: Initializes the token with a specified initial supply that is assigned to the contract creator.
- **`totalSupply`**: Returns the total supply of tokens.
- **`msgSender`**: Utility function to return the current message sender's address.
- **`transfer`**: Handles the transfer of tokens from one address to another, ensuring basic validation rules are met.
- **`balanceOf`**: Allows querying of the token balance of a given address.
- **`_preValidateTransfer`**: Performs additional checks before allowing a token transfer, such as ensuring the sender and recipient are not the same. More custom validation logic can be added if necessary.
