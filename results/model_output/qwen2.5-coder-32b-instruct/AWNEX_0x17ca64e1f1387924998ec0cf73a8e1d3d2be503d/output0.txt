Certainly! Below is the completed `Freezable` contract, which includes the implementation for freezing and unfreezing addresses, along with checking their freeze status. This contract adheres to the provided context and does not introduce any additional contracts or dependencies.

```

This contract provides the functionality to freeze and unfreeze addresses, ensuring that only the owner can modify the freeze status of an address. It also emits events whenever an address is frozen or unfrozen to provide transparency and traceability of these actions.
