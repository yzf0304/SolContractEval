```

### Key Points:
- The `Freezable` contract inherits from `Ownable`, meaning only the contract owner can freeze or unfreeze addresses.
- The `_frozen` mapping keeps track of whether an address is frozen (`true`) or not (`false`).
- The `freeze` function sets an address's status to frozen and emits a `Freeze` event.
- The `unFreeze` function sets an address's status to not frozen and emits an `Unfreeze` event.
- The `isFrozen` function allows checking the freeze status of an address.
- The `whenNotFrozen` modifier can be used in other functions to ensure they can only execute if a target address is not frozen.
- Added checks to prevent freezing or unfreezing the zero address, as it doesn't make sense in this context.
