Here's the complete implementation of the `BOTS` contract based on the provided context and description. The contract is implemented using Solidity compiler version 0.7.3 and follows the OpenZeppelin-like pattern.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.7.3;

contract BOTS is ERC20("Bot Ocean", "BOTS") {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    /**
     * @notice Mints new tokens to a specified address.
     * @dev Only the contract owner can call this function. It mints `_amount` of tokens to `_to`.
     * @param _to The address to which the tokens will be minted.
     * @param _amount The amount of tokens to mint.
     */
    function mint(
        address _to, 
        uint256 _amount
    ) 
        public 
        onlyOwner 
    {
        _mint(_to, _amount);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Burns a specified amount of tokens from a given address.
     * @dev Only the contract owner can call this function. It burns `_amount` of tokens from `_from`.
     * @param _from The address from which the tokens will be burned.
     * @param _amount The amount of tokens to burn.
     */
    function burn(
        address _from, 
        uint256 _amount
    ) 
        public 
        onlyOwner 
    {
        _burn(_from, _amount);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Sets a new name for the token.
     * @dev Only the contract owner can call this function. It updates the token's name to `_newName`.
     * @param _newName The new name for the token.
     */
    function setName(
        string memory _newName
    ) 
        public 
        onlyOwner 
    {
        _name = _newName;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Sets a new symbol for the token.
     * @dev Only the contract owner can call this function. It updates the token's symbol to `_newSymbol`.
     * @param _newSymbol The new symbol for the token.

     * @dev Only the contract owner can call this function. It updates the token's website to `_newWebsite`.
     * @param _newWebsite The new website for the token.
     */
    function setWebsite(
        string memory _newWebsite
    ) 
        public 
        onlyOwner 
    {
        _website = _newWebsite;
    }

    /**
     * @notice A fallback function for receiving tokens.
     * @dev This function is intended to handle incoming token transfers but currently reverts any calls.
     * @param _from The address from which the tokens are sent.
     * @param _value The amount of tokens being sent.
     * @param _data Additional data passed with the transfer.
     */

        uint256 _value, 
        bytes memory _data
    )

    {
        revert(); // Revert any calls to this function
    }

    /**
     * @notice Allows the owner to withdraw a specified amount of another ERC20 token from this contract.
     * @dev Only the contract owner can call this function. It transfers `_amount` of `_token` to the owner.
     * @param _token The ERC20 token to withdraw.
     * @param _amount The amount of the token to withdraw.
     */
    function takeOut(
        IERC20 _token, 
        uint256 _amount
    ) 
        external 
        onlyOwner 
    {
        require(address(this).balance >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
        _token.transfer(owner, _amount);

This contract includes all the functionalities described in your comments, such as minting, burning, setting token metadata, and handling token withdrawals. Please ensure that you have the necessary imports and dependencies (like `Address.sol` for the `using Address for address;` directive) available in your project setup.
