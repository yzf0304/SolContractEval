### Explanation:
- **Minting**: Utilizes the `_mint` function provided by the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation.
- **Burning**: Utilizes the `_burn` function provided by the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation.
- **Setters for Name, Symbol, Website**: Directly modify the respective state variables `_name`, `_symbol`, and `_website`.
- **tokenFallback**: Reverts any calls as it's designed not to accept tokens via fallback.
- **takeOut**: Allows the owner to withdraw any ERC20 tokens mistakenly sent to this contract back to the owner.

This contract should work as described and is compliant with the Solidity compiler version 0.7.3.
