Certainly! Below is the `BotMinting` contract completed according to your specifications. This contract handles the creation of promo and Gen0 bots, along with the logic for computing the next Gen0 auction price based on the average sale price.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;

contract BotMinting is BotAuction {

    uint256 public constant PROMO_CREATION_LIMIT = 5000;
    uint256 public constant GEN0_CREATION_LIMIT = 45000;
    uint256 public constant GEN0_STARTING_PRICE = 10 finney;
    uint256 public constant GEN0_AUCTION_DURATION = 1 days;

    uint256 public promoCreatedCount;
    uint256 public gen0CreatedCount;

    /**
     * @notice Creates a promo bot with the specified genes and assigns it to an owner.
     * @dev Only the COO can call this function. The bot owner defaults to the COO if not specified.
     * @param _genes The genetic makeup of the bot.
     * @param _owner The address of the owner of the new bot.
     */
    function createPromoBot(uint256 _genes, address _owner) external onlyCOO {
        require(promoCreatedCount < PROMO_CREATION_LIMIT, "Promo bot creation limit reached.");
        if (_owner == address(0)) {
            _owner = cooAddress;
        }
        _createBot(0, 0, 0, _genes, _owner);
        promoCreatedCount++;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Creates a Gen0 bot with the specified genes and starts an auction for it.
     * @dev Only the COO can call this function. The bot is initially owned by the contract and then put up for auction.
     * @param _genes The genetic makeup of the bot.
     */
    function createGen0Auction(uint256 _genes) external onlyCOO {
        require(gen0CreatedCount < GEN0_CREATION_LIMIT, "Gen0 bot creation limit reached.");
        uint256 botId = _createBot(0, 0, 0, _genes, address(this));
        uint256 startingPrice = _computeNextGen0Price();
        _approve(botId, saleAuction);
        saleAuction.createAuction(
            botId,
            startingPrice,
            0,

        gen0CreatedCount++;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Computes the next price for a Gen0 bot based on the average sale price.
     * @dev The price is calculated as the average sale price plus half of the average sale price. If the computed price is below the starting price, it defaults to the starting price.
     * @return The next price for a Gen0 bot.
     */
    function _computeNextGen0Price() internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 averagePrice = saleAuction.averageGen0SalePrice();
        uint256 nextPrice = averagePrice + (averagePrice / 2);
        if (nextPrice < GEN0_STARTING_PRICE) {
            nextPrice = GEN0_STARTING_PRICE;
        }
        return nextPrice;
    }

### Key Points:
- **createPromoBot**: This function creates a promo bot up to a maximum limit (`PROMO_CREATION_LIMIT`). The bot can be assigned to a specific owner, but defaults to the COO if no owner is specified.
- **createGen0Auction**: This function creates a Gen0 bot, which is then immediately put up for auction up to a maximum limit (`GEN0_CREATION_LIMIT`).
- **_computeNextGen0Price**: This internal function computes the starting price for a new Gen0 bot auction by taking the average sale price of the last five Gen0 bots sold and adding half of that value to it. If this calculated price is less than the predefined starting price (`GEN0_STARTING_PRICE`), it uses the starting price instead.
