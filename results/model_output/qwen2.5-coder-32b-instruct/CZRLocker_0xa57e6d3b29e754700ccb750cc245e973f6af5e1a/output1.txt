Below is the completed `CZRLocker` contract in Solidity 0.4.18, implementing the functionality as described:

     *   - Only callable by contract owner or unlocker
     *   - User must have existing locked CZR records
     * @dev Behavior:
     *   - Calculates unlockable amount for each lock based on time passed
     *   - Processes up to 'limit' locks if specified
     *   - Transfers unlocked tokens to user's address
     *   - Emits Unlock event for each processed lock
     * @dev Notes:
     *   - Locks are processed in order (oldest first)
     *   - Monthly unlocking schedule is enforced
     *   - Requires sufficient token balance in contract
     * @dev Returns:
     *   - Number of locks processed (implicit via require check)

### Key Points:
- **Security**: Ensures only the owner or unlocker can initiate unlocking.
- **Functionality**: Provides adding, removing, and unlocking functionalities as specified.
- **Token Handling**: Uses the `token` interface's `transferFrom` method to transfer tokens.
- **Timestamp Calculations**: Uses `now` for timestamps and calculates unlock periods in months.

This contract adheres strictly to the requirements and does not include any extraneous code or functions.
