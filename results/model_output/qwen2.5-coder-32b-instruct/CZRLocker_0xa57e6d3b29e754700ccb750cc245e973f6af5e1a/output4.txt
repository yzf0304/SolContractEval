This implementation includes the missing functionalities in `removeCZRLock`, `addCZRLock`, and `unlockCZR` methods while adhering to the Solidity version 0.4.18 and the specified requirements. The `unlockCZR` method includes logic to process locks according to the described rules, emitting `Unlock` events for each successfully processed lock. The `withdrawEth` method enables the owner to withdraw ETH from the contract.
