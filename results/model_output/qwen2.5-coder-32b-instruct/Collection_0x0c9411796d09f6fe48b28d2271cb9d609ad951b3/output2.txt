Here is the completed and functional `Collection` contract based on the provided context and description. The contract has been implemented to ensure that only the owner can execute critical functions, and the necessary logic has been added to the contract methods.

This contract ensures that all functions requiring the original creator's permission include a check to confirm `msg.sender` is indeed the `createAddress`. This aligns with the requirement to restrict functionality based on the original contract deployer.
