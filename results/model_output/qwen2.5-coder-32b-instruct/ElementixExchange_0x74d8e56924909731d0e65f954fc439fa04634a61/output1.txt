Below is the completed `ProxyRegistry` contract implementing the described functionality:

```solidity
/**
 * @title ProxyRegistry
 * @notice A registry for managing proxy contracts and their permissions.
 * @dev This contract allows the owner to grant and revoke access to specific contracts, and users to register their own proxy contracts.
 */
contract ProxyRegistry is Ownable {

    /* DelegateProxy implementation contract. Must be initialized. */
    address public delegateProxyImplementation;

    /* Authenticated proxies by user. */
    mapping(address => OwnableDelegateProxy) public proxies;

    /* Contracts pending access. */
    mapping(address => uint256) public pending;

    /* Contracts allowed to call those proxies. */
    mapping(address => bool) public contracts;

    /* Delay period for adding an authenticated contract.
       This mitigates a particular class of potential attack on the Elementix DAO (which owns this registry) - if at any point the value of assets held by proxy contracts exceeded the value of half the ELT supply (votes in the DAO),
       a malicious but rational attacker could buy half the Elementix and grant themselves access to all the proxy contracts. A delay period renders this attack nonthreatening - given one weeks, if that happened, users would have
       plenty of time to notice and transfer their assets.

    uint256 public DELAY_PERIOD = 7 days;

Please note that this code assumes the existence of the `OwnableDelegateProxy` contract, which must have an `initialize` function taking an `address` parameter. This contract is not defined in the provided code snippet and must be included elsewhere in your project. The `delegateProxyImplementation` must also be set to the correct address before calling `registerProxy`.
