Below is the completed `ProxyRegistry` contract based on your provided description and structure. The contract includes implementations for the `startGrantAuthentication`, `endGrantAuthentication`, `revokeAuthentication`, and `registerProxy` functions, using the OpenZeppelin `Ownable` pattern and following your compiler version and structural constraints.

This contract follows the provided specifications, utilizing OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract for ownership control, and includes functions to manage proxy registration and contract authentication with delay mechanisms as described. The cloning logic is implemented to create new instances of the delegate proxy contract. Please ensure that the `OwnableDelegateProxy` contract has the correct interface and constructor for seamless integration.
