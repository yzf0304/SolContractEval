To implement the `StandardToken` contract following the provided context and ensuring compatibility with Solidity version 0.4.16, we need to complete the missing functions and ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC20 standard. Since version 0.4.16 does not support SafeMath directly, we will need to define its functions inline or assume they are available in the context. For this implementation, I'll include a simple SafeMath library within the contract scope.

Here's the complete `StandardToken` contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.16;

contract ERC20 {

    uint256 public totalSupply;

    function balanceOf(address who) constant returns (uint256);

    function transfer(address to, uint256 value) returns (bool);

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

    function allowance(address owner, address spender) constant returns (uint256);

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) returns (bool);

    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) returns (bool);

    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
}

/**
 * @title StandardToken
 * @dev Implementation of the basic standard token with ERC20 functionality.
 * @notice This contract provides a basic implementation of an ERC20 token, including balance tracking and allowance management.
 */
contract StandardToken is ERC20 {

    // Simple SafeMath library inclusion
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        assert(c >= a);
        return c;
    }

    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        assert(b <= a);
        return a - b;
    }

    mapping(address => uint256) balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) allowed;

    /**
     * @notice Returns the balance of the specified address.
     * @param _owner The address to query the balance of.
     * @return The balance of the specified address.
     * @dev This function is used to check the balance of a specific address.
     */
    function balanceOf(address _owner) constant returns (uint256 balance) {
        return balances[_owner];
    }

    /**
     * @notice Approves the specified address to spend a certain amount of tokens on behalf of the message sender.
     * @param _spender The address which will spend the funds.
     * @param _value The amount of tokens to be spent.
     * @return True if the approval was successful.
     * @dev To change the approve amount, you first have to reduce the addresses' allowance to zero by calling `approve(_spender, 0)` if it is not already 0 to mitigate the race condition described here: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
     */
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) returns (bool) {
        allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Returns the remaining number of tokens that `_spender` is allowed to spend on behalf of `_owner`.
     * @param _owner The address of the token owner.
     * @param _spender The address of the spender.
     * @return The remaining allowance for the spender.
     * @dev This function is used to check the remaining allowance for a specific spender.
     */
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns (uint256 remaining) {
        return allowed[_owner][_spender];
    }

    /**
     * @notice Transfers tokens from the caller's account to another address.
     * @param _to The address to transfer tokens to.
     * @param _value The amount of tokens to transfer.
     * @return True if the transfer was successful.
     * @dev Transfers the specified amount of tokens to another address, reducing the sender's balance.
     */
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool) {
        balances[msg.sender] = sub(balances[msg.sender], _value);
        balances[_to] = add(balances[_to], _value);
        Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }

     * @param _value The amount of tokens to transfer.
     * @return True if the transfer was successful.
     * @dev Transfers the specified amount of tokens on behalf of the owner to another address.
     */
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) returns (bool) {
        var _allowance = allowed[_from][msg.sender];

        balances[_to] = add(balances[_to], _value);
        balances[_from] = sub(balances[_from], _value);
        allowed[_from][msg.sender] = sub(_allowance, _value);
        Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }
}
```

This implementation includes basic token functionalities: balance checking, transferring tokens, approving spending, and checking allowances. It uses a simple SafeMath library to prevent arithmetic overflows and underflows, which is critical in Solidity programming to prevent vulnerabilities.
