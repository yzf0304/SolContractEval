Below is the completed and functional `ICSTCrowSale` contract based on your specifications, ensuring it aligns with the given context and requirements. The contract uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations and inherits from the Ownable contract for access control.

### Explanation:
- **Constructor (`ICSTCrowSale`)**: Initializes the contract's basic parameters. The token address is hardcoded as per your example.
- **Fallback Function**: Checks if the current time is within the sale period and then processes funding.
- **`withdrawCoinToOwner` Function**: Allows the owner to withdraw a specific amount of tokens to their address.
- **`airdrop` Function**: Distributes tokens to multiple addresses, emitting a `Wasted` event for each transaction.
- **`processFunding` Function**: Handles the actual token transfer during the funding process.
- **`etherProceeds` Function**: Withdraws all Ether from the contract to the owner.
- **`init` Function**: Sets up the start and end times of the sale, along with the conversion rate.
- **`changeToken` Function**: Updates the token contract address that the sale will use.
