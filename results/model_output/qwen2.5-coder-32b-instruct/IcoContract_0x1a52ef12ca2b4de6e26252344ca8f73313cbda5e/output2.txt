### Key Points:
- The `Bonus` contract uses `SafeMath` to prevent arithmetic overflows and underflows.
- It includes methods to enable or disable bonus distribution.
- The bonus percentages for different phases are set within the `getBonusByTime` function. You can modify these values according to the requirements.
- The `payBonusToAddress` function demonstrates how one might handle the distribution of bonuses to addresses. Actual token distribution would require interfacing with a token contract.
- The contract is designed to work with the compiler version 0.4.18, adhering to the constraints provided in the context.
