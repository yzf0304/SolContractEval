Below is the completed Kubera smart contract with the necessary functionality implemented based on the provided description and requirements. This contract adheres to the ERC20 standard and includes features like a burn function and ICO management. The contract is written in Solidity version 0.4.11.

```

This contract includes functions for basic token operations such as `transfer`, `approve`, and `transferFrom`, along with additional logic to handle the ICO phases and post-ICO token burning. It ensures that token transfers respect the ICO rules and conditions, particularly during the pre-ICO and ICO phases.
