Below is the complete implementation of the `KyberGenesisToken` contract based on the provided context and requirements. The contract includes functionalities for minting tokens (with a restriction that each address can hold only one token), ending the minting process, burning tokens, and draining accidentally sent ERC20 tokens.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.15;

contract Ownable {
  address public owner;

  function Ownable() {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    _;
  }

  function transferOwnership(address newOwner) onlyOwner {
    if (newOwner != address(0)) {
      owner = newOwner;
    }
  }
}

contract ERC20Interface {
  function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success) {}
  function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool success) {}
}

contract KyberGenesisToken is Ownable {
  string  public  constant name     = "Kyber Genesis Token";
  string  public  constant symbol   = "KGT";
  uint    public  constant decimals = 0;

  uint                   public totalSupply = 0;
  mapping(address=>uint) public balanceOf;
  mapping(address=>bool) public mintedAddresses;

  event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint _value);
  event EndMinting(uint timestamp);

  function KyberGenesisToken(address minter) {
    transferOwnership(minter);
  }

  function mint(address[] recipients) onlyOwner {
    for (uint i = 0; i < recipients.length; i++) {
      address recipient = recipients[i];
      if (!mintedAddresses[recipient]) {
        mintedAddresses[recipient] = true;
        balanceOf[recipient] += 1;
        totalSupply += 1;
        Transfer(0x0, recipient, 1);
      }
    }
  }

  function endMinting() onlyOwner {
    transferOwnership(0x0); // Transfer ownership to a dead address
    EndMinting(now);
  }

  function burn() {
    require(balanceOf[msg.sender] == 1);
    balanceOf[msg.sender] -= 1;
    totalSupply -= 1;
    Transfer(msg.sender, 0x0, 1);
  }

  function emergencyERC20Drain(ERC20Interface token, uint amount) {
    token.transfer(owner, amount);
  }

  function transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool) {
    revert(); // Not implemented in this contract
  }

  function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) returns (bool) {
    revert(); // Not implemented in this contract
  }

  function approve(address _spender, uint _value) returns (bool) {
    revert(); // Not implemented in this contract
  }

  function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) constant returns (uint) {
    return 0; // Not implemented in this contract
  }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Minting**: The `mint` function allows the owner to assign one token to each address in a list of recipients. Addresses that already received a token are ignored.
- **Ending Minting**: The `endMinting` function transfers ownership to a zero address, effectively ending the minting process.
- **Burning**: The `burn` function allows token holders to burn their single token.
- **Emergency Drain**: The `emergencyERC20Drain` function allows anyone to transfer any ERC20 tokens mistakenly sent to the contract to the owner.
- **Non-implemented ERC20 Functions**: The contract reverts for `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance` functions as they are not implemented.
