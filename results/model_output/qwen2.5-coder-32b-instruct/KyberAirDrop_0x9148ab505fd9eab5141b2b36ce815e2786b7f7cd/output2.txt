This contract includes:

- Initialization logic to set the contract's owner to the specified minter.
- Minting functionality that allows the owner to distribute tokens to multiple recipients, ensuring no recipient receives more than one token.
- Functionality to end minting and transfer ownership to a dead address (0xdead).
- Burn functionality that allows token holders to burn their single token.
- An emergency function to withdraw accidental ERC20 token deposits from the contract to a predefined multisig address.
- Basic ERC20 stubs that revert when called, as these functionalities are not supported by this contract.
