Certainly! Below is the complete and functional `KyberContributorWhitelist` contract according to your specifications, using Solidity compiler version 0.4.13:

```solidity

### Key Points:
- **Constructor**: Initializes the `owner` variable to the deployer's address.
- **listAddress**: Sets a specific contribution cap for a single address. Emits an `ListAddress` event.
- **listAddresses**: Sets contribution caps for multiple addresses at once. It also emits an `ListAddress` event for each address listed.
- **setSlackUsersCap**: Updates the global cap for addresses with a cap value of 1.
- **getCap**: Returns the effective contribution cap for a given address.
- **destroy**: Self-destructs the contract, sending any remaining funds to the owner.

This contract adheres to the specified requirements and operates within the constraints of Solidity version 0.4.13.
