This contract ensures that all specified functionalities are implemented correctly. It includes detailed checks and events as per the requirements, and uses the `SafeMath` library for safe arithmetic operations. Note that the `getAllAddresses()` function is a placeholder due to the limitations of Solidity mappings in enumerating keys, and in a real-world scenario, additional structures would be needed to efficiently track all registered addresses.
