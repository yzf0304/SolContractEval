To implement the `HEXToken` contract as described, we need to define several mappings and variables to keep track of token balances, stakes, allowances, and more. Here's a complete implementation that fits within the constraints provided:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.13;

contract HEXToken {
    // Events for logging actions
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
    event StakeStarted(address indexed staker, uint256 amount, uint256 duration);
    event StakeEnded(address indexed staker, uint256 amount);

    // Variables to track total supply and balances
    uint256 private _totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) private _allowances;

    // Variables to track stakes
    struct Stake {
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 startDate;
        uint256 duration; // Duration in days
        uint40 id;
    }

    mapping(address => Stake[]) private _stakes;
    uint40 private _lastStakeId = 0;

    // Function to return the current day
    function currentDay() external view returns (uint256) {
        return block.timestamp / 1 days;
    }

    // Function to start a new stake
    function stakeStart(uint256 newStakedHearts, uint256 newStakedDays) external {
        require(newStakedHearts > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
        require(newStakedDays > 0, "Duration must be greater than 0");
        require(_balances[msg.sender] >= newStakedHearts, "Insufficient balance");

        _balances[msg.sender] -= newStakedHearts;

        Stake memory newStake = Stake({
            amount: newStakedHearts,
            startDate: block.timestamp,
            duration: newStakedDays,
            id: _lastStakeId++
        });

        _stakes[msg.sender].push(newStake);

        emit StakeStarted(msg.sender, newStakedHearts, newStakedDays);
    }

    // Function to end a stake
    function stakeEnd(uint256 stakeIndex, uint40 stakeIdParam) public {
        require(stakeIndex < _stakes[msg.sender].length, "Invalid stake index");
        Stake storage s = _stakes[msg.sender][stakeIndex];
        require(s.id == stakeIdParam, "Invalid stake ID");
        require(block.timestamp >= s.startDate + s.duration * 1 days, "Stake period not over yet");

        _balances[msg.sender] += s.amount;

        emit StakeEnded(msg.sender, s.amount);

        // Remove stake entry or mark it as ended if needed
        delete _stakes[msg.sender][stakeIndex];
    }

    // Function to approve a spender
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
        _allowances[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }

    // Function to transfer HEX
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
        require(recipient != address(0), "Recipient is the zero address");
        require(_balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

        _balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        _balances[recipient] += amount;

        emit Transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount);
        return true;
    }

    // Function to return the number of stakes for a given address
    function stakeCount(address stakerAddr) external view returns (uint256) {
        return _stakes[stakerAddr].length;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Balances and Allowances**: We use a mapping to store the balance of each address and another mapping to store approvals.
- **Stakes**: Each stake is represented as a struct and stored in an array mapped to each address's stakes.
- **currentDay**: Returns the current day using block timestamp.
- **stakeStart**: Allows users to stake tokens, deducting them from the sender's balance and recording the stake details.
- **stakeEnd**: Ends a specific stake if its duration has passed, adding the staked amount back to the user's balance.
- **approve**: Allows token holder to approve another address to spend a certain amount of their tokens.
- **transfer**: Transfers a certain amount of tokens from the sender to another address.
- **stakeCount**: Returns the number of stakes associated with a particular address.
