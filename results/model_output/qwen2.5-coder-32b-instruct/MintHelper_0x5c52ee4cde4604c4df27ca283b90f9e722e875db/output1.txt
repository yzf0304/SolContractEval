To complete the `MintHelper` contract according to the provided context, we need to ensure it integrates with the `ERC918Interface` for the minting functionality and uses `SafeMath` for safe arithmetic operations. However, since we cannot add new dependencies or additional contracts, we'll assume `SafeMath` is already included in the environment. Hereâ€™s the completed contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.10;

/**
 * @notice This contract serves as a helper for minting tokens and managing token transfers. It allows the owner to set a mintable token, proxy minting of tokens, and manage token and ETH withdrawals. The contract also supports batch sending of tokens to multiple addresses.
 * @dev Inherits from OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract for access control. Uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows/underflows. Implements a mapping to track successful payments by payment ID.
 */

### Explanation:
- **setMintableToken**: Allows the owner to set the address of the mintable token.
- **paymentSuccessful**: Checks if a payment (identified by `paymentId`) has been successfully marked.
- **proxyMint**: Calls the `mint` function on the `mintableToken` contract, passing the `nonce` and `challenge_digest`.
- **withdraw**: Allows the owner to withdraw all the ETH held in the contract.
- **send**: Allows the owner to send tokens from another ERC20 contract to a destination address.
- **multisend**: Allows the owner to send tokens to multiple addresses in one transaction, with a unique `paymentId` to prevent reusing the same payment details.
