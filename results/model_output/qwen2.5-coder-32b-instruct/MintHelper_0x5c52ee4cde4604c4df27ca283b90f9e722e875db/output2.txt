To complete the `MintHelper` contract according to the provided specifications and context, we need to implement the missing functions. Since the contract is meant to be compatible with Solidity 0.5.10 and interacts with both ERC20 and ERC918 tokens, we will incorporate the necessary logic while adhering to these constraints. We will also implement the `SafeMath` library manually since it's not explicitly imported in the given context.

Here's the completed `MintHelper` contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.10;

contract Ownable {
    address private _owner;

    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);

    /**
     * @dev Initializes the contract setting the deployer as the initial owner.
     */
    constructor () internal {
        _owner = msg.sender;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(address(0), _owner);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Returns the address of the current owner.
     */
    function owner() public view returns (address) {
        return _owner;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Throws if called by any account other than the owner.
     */
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(isOwner(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");
        _;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Returns true if the caller is the current owner.
     */
    function isOwner() public view returns (bool) {
        return msg.sender == _owner;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Leaves the contract without owner. It will not be possible to call
     * `onlyOwner` functions anymore. Can only be called by the current owner.
     *
     * > Note: Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner,
     * thereby removing any functionality that is only available to the owner.
     */
    function renounceOwnership() public onlyOwner {
        emit OwnershipTransferred(_owner, address(0));
        _owner = address(0);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`).
     * Can only be called by the current owner.
     */
    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
        _transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Transfers ownership of the contract to a new account (`newOwner`).
     */
    function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal {
        require(newOwner != address(0), "Ownable: new owner is the zero address");
        emit OwnershipTransferred(_owner, newOwner);
        _owner = newOwner;
    }
}

        require(!paymentSuccessful(paymentId), "Payment ID already used");

        ERC20Interface token = ERC20Interface(_tokenAddr);
        uint256 successfulTransfers = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < dests.length; i++) {
            if (token.transfer(dests[i], values[i])) {
                successfulTransfers++;
            }
        }

        // Mark the payment as successful
        successfulPayments[paymentId] = true;
        return successfulTransfers;
    }
}
```

This implementation adheres to the Solidity 0.5.10 compiler requirements and includes all functionalities described in the contract's documentation, such as setting the mintable token, checking payment status, proxy minting tokens, withdrawing ETH, transferring tokens, and batch sending tokens to multiple recipients.
