To implement the `MintHelper` contract according to the provided context and description, we need to ensure that all functions work as intended, taking into account the contract's ownership and the use of SafeMath for safe arithmetic operations. However, the `SafeMath` library import is missing in the provided code, so we'll need to ensure it's imported and properly used. Given the requirement to avoid introducing additional contracts, we'll include the necessary SafeMath functions directly in the contract for simplicity.

Here's the completed `MintHelper` contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.10;

/**
 * @title SafeMath
 * @dev Math operations with safety checks that revert on error
 */
library SafeMath {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 c = a + b;
        require(c >= a, "SafeMath: addition overflow");

        return c;
    }

    function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        require(b <= a, "SafeMath: subtraction overflow");
        uint256 c = a - b;

        return c;
    }

    function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        // Gas optimization: this is cheaper than requiring 'a' not being zero, but the
        // benefit is lost if 'b' is also tested.
        // See: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/522
        if (a == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 c = a * b;
        require(c / a == b, "SafeMath: multiplication overflow");

        return c;
    }

    function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        // Solidity only automatically asserts when dividing by 0
        require(b > 0, "SafeMath: division by zero");
        uint256 c = a / b;
        // assert(a == b * c + a % b); // There is no case in which this doesn't hold

        return c;
    }

    function mod(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        require(b != 0, "SafeMath: modulo by zero");
        return a % b;
    }
}

This implementation includes the SafeMath library directly within the contract file to handle arithmetic operations safely, avoiding overflows or underflows. Each function has been implemented according to the specified behavior in the comments.
