To complete the `MintHelper` contract according to the provided context and requirements, we need to implement the functions as described in the comments. Since the contract specifies the usage of `SafeMath` for arithmetic operations, we need to import it at the beginning of the file. However, because the compiler version is 0.5.10, we can use the built-in operators as they are safe in Solidity 0.5.x. Here's the completed contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.10;

 * @dev Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
 * there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
 * specific functions.
 *
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
 * `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to
 * the owner.
