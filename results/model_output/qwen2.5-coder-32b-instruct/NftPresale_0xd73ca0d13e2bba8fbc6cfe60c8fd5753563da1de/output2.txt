Certainly! Below is the completed `NftPresale` contract based on your requirements and descriptions. This implementation includes the logic for buying NFTs, verifying signatures, and allowing the owner to withdraw funds.

### Key Points:
1. **Presale Time Window**: The contract checks if the current block timestamp is within the defined presale start and finish times.
2. **Single Purchase per Address**: Each buyer can only purchase one token during the presale.
3. **Correct Payment Amount**: The function ensures the exact presale price is paid.
4. **Signature Verification**: The `buy` function verifies that the message has been signed by the predefined `verifyAddress`.
5. **Token Minting**: Once verified, the contract mints an NFT to the buyerâ€™s address.
6. **Fund Withdrawal**: The owner can withdraw all ETH collected from the presale to the receiver address.
