### Key Features:
- **Presale Window**: The `buy` function checks that the current block timestamp falls within the defined `START_TIME` and `FINISH_TIME`.
- **Single Purchase Per Address**: Tracks buyers using a mapping to prevent multiple purchases by a single address.
- **Signature Verification**: Validates the signature using `ecrecover` to ensure the purchase request is authorized.
- **Payment Handling**: Confirms that the correct amount is sent and transfers the funds to the predefined receiver address.
- **Admin Functionality**: Allows the owner to withdraw accumulated funds from the contract via the `cashOut` function.
