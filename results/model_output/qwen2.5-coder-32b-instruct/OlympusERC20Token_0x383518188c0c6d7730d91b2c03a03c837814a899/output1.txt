### Explanation:
- **Constructor**: Initializes the token with the name "Olympus", symbol "OHM", and 9 decimal places.
- **mint**: This function allows the Vault (onlyVault modifier) to mint tokens to a specified account.
- **burn**: This function allows the token holder to burn tokens from their own balance.
- **burnFrom**: This function allows burning tokens from a specific account on behalf of another account. It checks and reduces the allowance of the caller for the given account.

The contract inherits the necessary functionalities from the `Divine` contract and utilizes the `SafeMath` library to ensure safe arithmetic operations. The `onlyVault()` modifier ensures that only the Vault can call certain functions.
