Certainly! Below is the complete and functional `OlympusERC20Token` contract, which inherits from the `Divine` contract, implements the required minting and burning functionalities, and adheres to the provided context and description. The contract is designed to compile with Solidity version 0.7.5.

### Explanation:
- **Constructor**: Initializes the token with the name "Olympus", symbol "OHM", and 9 decimal places.
- **mint**: Allows the vault to mint tokens to a specified account.
- **burn**: Allows a holder to burn their tokens.
- **burnFrom**: Allows another account to burn tokens from an account, provided it has the necessary allowance.
- **_burnFrom**: An internal function used by `burnFrom` to perform the token burning and update the allowance accordingly.

This contract ensures that only the vault can mint tokens, and that token holders can burn their tokens directly or have tokens burned from their account by another account with the appropriate allowance.
