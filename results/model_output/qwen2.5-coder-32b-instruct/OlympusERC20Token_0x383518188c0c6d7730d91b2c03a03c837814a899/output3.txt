Below is the complete implementation of the `OlympusERC20Token` contract according to the provided context and description. This contract inherits from the `Divine` contract, includes minting and burning functionalities, and adheres to the ERC20 standard with additional features like TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) Oracle updating.

### Key Points Implemented:
- **Constructor**: Initializes the token with the name "Olympus", symbol "OHM", and 9 decimals.
- **Mint Functionality**: Allows minting of tokens only by the Vault, using the internal `_mint` function.
- **Burn Functionality**: Allows burning of tokens by the token owner, using the internal `_burn` function. Also provides a function to burn tokens from a specific account on behalf of a spender, ensuring the spender has enough allowance.
- **TWAP Oracle Updates**: Overrides `_beforeTokenTransfer` to ensure TWAP is updated when tokens are transferred to or from registered TWAP sources.
- **Safety Checks**: Utilizes SafeMath for arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow.
- **Compliance**: Inherits from `Divine`, which provides additional functionalities such as TWAP oracle management and source registration.
