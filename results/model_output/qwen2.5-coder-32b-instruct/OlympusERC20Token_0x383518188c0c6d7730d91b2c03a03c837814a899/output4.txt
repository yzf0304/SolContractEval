### Key Points:
- **Mint Function**: Only callable by the Vault.
- **Burn Function**: Allows the token holder to burn their own tokens.
- **BurnFrom Function**: Allows any user to burn tokens from a specified account if they have sufficient allowance.
- **_burnFrom Function**: Internally used by `burnFrom` to handle allowance updates and token burning.
- **_beforeTokenTransfer Hook**: Automatically triggers a TWAP update when tokens are transferred to or from a dex pool source registered in the contract.
