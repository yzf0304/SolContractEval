Here's the completed `PaymentForwarder` contract based on your requirements, targeting the Solidity compiler version 0.4.18. The contract includes the necessary logic to handle payments, track contributions, and ensure that payments can be halted in emergencies.

```solidity

   * account.

### Key Points:
- **Checksum Calculation**: The `calculateChecksum` function is a simplistic placeholder. In practice, you would replace this with a proper checksum algorithm to ensure payment integrity.
- **Modifiers**: The `stopInEmergency` modifier is used to prevent actions during an emergency halt.
- **Events**: The `PaymentForwarded` event logs each successful payment.
- **Fallback Function**: The fallback function is implemented to revert any direct Ether transfers to the contract, ensuring payments are made through the intended methods.
