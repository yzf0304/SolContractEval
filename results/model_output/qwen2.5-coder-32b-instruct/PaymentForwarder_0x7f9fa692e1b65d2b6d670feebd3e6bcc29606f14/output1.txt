Here's the completed `PaymentForwarder` contract following the guidelines you provided. This contract includes the necessary logic for handling payments and ensuring data integrity through checksums. Since the compiler version is 0.4.18, some syntax differences are used compared to newer versions of Solidity.

```solidity
/**
 * @title PaymentForwarder
 * @notice A contract to forward payments to a team multisig address, tracking the total amount transferred, number of customers, and individual customer and benefactor contributions.
 * @dev This contract inherits from Haltable, allowing for emergency stops. It records payments and forwards them to a specified team multisig address.

```

### Key Points:
- **Payments**: Payments are recorded against both `customerId` and `benefactor`. The total transferred amount is updated accordingly.
- **Checksum Verification**: Functions `pay`, `payForMyselfWithChecksum` use a simple checksum to verify the legitimacy of the payment before processing.
- **Fallback Function**: The fallback function reverts any direct Ether transfers, enforcing that all payments must go through one of the payment methods.
- **Halting Mechanism**: The `Haltable` base contract provides an emergency stop mechanism that can halt all transactions except for those that restore the system from an emergency state.

This contract assumes a basic checksum calculation and might need more sophisticated checks depending on your specific requirements.
