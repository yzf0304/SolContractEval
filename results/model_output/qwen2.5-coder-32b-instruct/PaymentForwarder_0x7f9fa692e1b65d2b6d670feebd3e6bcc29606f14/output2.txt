To complete the `PaymentForwarder` contract as described, we need to implement the payment functions to handle incoming payments, track contributions by customers and beneficiaries, and forward these funds to the `teamMultisig` address. Here is the completed contract:

```solidity
/**
 * @title PaymentForwarder
 * @notice A contract to forward payments to a team multisig address, tracking the total amount transferred, number of customers, and individual customer and benefactor contributions.
 * @dev This contract inherits from Haltable, allowing for emergency stops. It records payments and forwards them to a specified team multisig address.
 */
contract PaymentForwarder is Haltable {

  /** Who will get all ETH in the end */
  address public teamMultisig;

  /** Total incoming money */
  uint public totalTransferred;

  /** How many distinct customers we have that have made a payment */
  uint public customerCount;

  /** Total incoming money per centrally tracked customer id */
  mapping(uint128 => uint) public paymentsByCustomer;

  /** Total incoming money per benefactor address */
  mapping(address => uint) public paymentsByBenefactor;

  /** A customer has made a payment. Benefactor is the address where the tokens will be ultimately issued. */
  event PaymentForwarded(address source, uint amount, uint128 customerId, address benefactor);

  /**
   * @notice Initializes the contract with the owner and team multisig addresses.
   * @dev Sets the `teamMultisig` and `owner` addresses.
   * @param _owner The address of the contract owner.
   * @param _teamMultisig The address of the team multisig wallet.
   */
  function PaymentForwarder(address _owner, address _teamMultisig) {
    teamMultisig = _teamMultisig;
    owner = _owner;
  }

  /**
   * @notice Allows a customer to make a payment without a checksum.
   * @dev Records the payment, updates the total transferred, and forwards the payment to the team multisig address.
   * @param customerId The unique identifier for the customer.
   * @param benefactor The address that will benefit from the payment.

  function payWithoutChecksum(uint128 customerId, address benefactor) public stopInEmergency payable {
    require(msg.value > 0);
    
    totalTransferred += msg.value;
    paymentsByCustomer[customerId] += msg.value;
    paymentsByBenefactor[benefactor] += msg.value;

    if (paymentsByCustomer[customerId] == msg.value) {
      customerCount++;
    }

    teamMultisig.transfer(msg.value);
    emit PaymentForwarded(msg.sender, msg.value, customerId, benefactor);
  }

    payWithoutChecksum(customerId, benefactor);
  }

```

### Key Points:
- **Checksum Verification**: Added a `computeChecksum` method for computing a basic checksum for address verification. In practice, you might want a more secure checksum mechanism.
- **Payment Handling**: All payment functions delegate to `payWithoutChecksum` after necessary checks (like checksum validation).
- **Tracking Contributions**: Tracks payments by customer ID and benefactor address, updating totals and counting distinct customers.
- **Emergency Stop**: Utilizes the `Haltable` contract's modifiers to prevent operations during an emergency halt.
- **Revert for Direct Transfers**: The fallback function reverts if the contract receives Ether directly, ensuring funds can only be sent via the defined payment methods.
