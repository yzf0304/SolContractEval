Here is the complete and functional `PaymentForwarder` smart contract based on the provided context, description, and comments. This contract adheres to Solidity version 0.4.18 and includes the logic required for forwarding payments while keeping track of the necessary data.

```solidity
/**
 * @title PaymentForwarder
 * @notice A contract to forward payments to a team multisig address, tracking the total amount transferred, number of customers, and individual customer and benefactor contributions.
 * @dev This contract inherits from Haltable, allowing for emergency stops. It records payments and forwards them to a specified team multisig address.
 */
contract PaymentForwarder is Haltable {

### Key Notes:
- **Checksum Verification**: In this example, the checksum verification logic is simplified to just check if the checksum matches the first byte of the benefactor or sender address. You should implement a more secure method of checksum validation as per your specific requirements.
- **Fallback Function**: The fallback function is set to revert to prevent direct Ether transfers that do not use the intended payment functions.
- **Error Handling**: The contract uses `require()` statements to handle errors, such as ensuring non-zero value payments and verifying checksums.
