### Key Points:
- **Checksum Calculation**: The checksum is calculated as the last byte of the beneficiary's address. This is done in the `calculateChecksum` method.
- **Emergency Stop Mechanism**: The `Haltable` contract functionality is utilized to allow an emergency stop of payments.
- **Event Logging**: Every payment is logged with the `PaymentForwarded` event.
- **Payment Forwarding**: Payments are immediately forwarded to the `teamMultisig` address after they are recorded.
- **Fallback Function**: Direct sending of ether without calling a function results in a revert to prevent misoperations.
