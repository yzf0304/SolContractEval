To complete the `RBInformationStore` contract, we need to implement the functions defined as placeholders. These functions will allow the multi-signature wallet to update the respective variables within the contract. Here's the completed contract:

```solidity
// Below are some contexts potentially relevant to contract code generation.

/**

contract Ownable {

  address public owner;

  function Ownable() {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  modifier onlyOwner() {
    if (msg.sender != owner) {
      revert();
    }
    _;
  }

}

/**

```

### Key Points:
- The `onlyMultiSig` modifier is applied to all functions that modify the state of the contract, ensuring they can only be called by the multi-signature wallet.
- The `changeIsPayableEnabledForAll` function toggles the `isPayableEnabledForAll` flag, allowing or disallowing the contract to receive Ether.
- A fallback function is included to handle receiving Ether, but it checks the `isPayableEnabledForAll` flag before accepting any Ether.
