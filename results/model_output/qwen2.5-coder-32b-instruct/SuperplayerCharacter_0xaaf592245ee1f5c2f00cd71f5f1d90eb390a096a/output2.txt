Below is the completed `SuperplayerCharacter` smart contract based on the provided context and descriptions. The contract uses the `SafeMath` library to handle arithmetic operations securely and includes all necessary functions and events as specified.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice This contract manages a set of characters that users can select. Each character has an ID and a weight, which is used in a weighted random selection process. The contract also allows the owner to add new characters, set a fee for changing characters, and withdraw funds.
 * @dev The contract uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations to prevent overflows and underflows. It also emits events and maintains mappings and arrays to track character selections and configurations.
