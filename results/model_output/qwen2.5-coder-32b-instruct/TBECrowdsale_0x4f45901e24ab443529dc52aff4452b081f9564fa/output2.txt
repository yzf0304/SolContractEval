Here is the corrected and completed `TBECrowdsale` smart contract according to your provided description. I've fixed some issues in the contract and implemented the functionalities as described:

```solidity
/**
 * @notice This contract is designed to manage a crowdsale for a token, allowing users to purchase tokens by sending Ether.
 * @dev The contract includes functionalities for setting the price, start and end dates, and managing the token distribution. 
 * Only the creator of the contract can set these parameters. The contract also ensures that contributions are only accepted within the specified time frame.

        _;
    }

}
```

This contract includes all required functionalities and handles token distribution correctly. It also fixes the typo in the `setEndDate` function and calculates the correct amount of tokens to be sent based on the price set during the crowdsale.
