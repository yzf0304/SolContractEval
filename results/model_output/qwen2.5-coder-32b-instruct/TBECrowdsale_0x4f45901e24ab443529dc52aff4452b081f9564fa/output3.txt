### Key Corrections:
- Fixed the fallback function to correctly calculate the number of tokens based on the sent Ether amount.
- Added a check to ensure the transfer of tokens succeeds before proceeding with the rest of the operations.
- Corrected the condition in the fallback function to allow contributions at both the start and end dates.
- Removed the unused `tokenAddress` mapping as it wasn't used anywhere.
- Ensured that the function names follow proper conventions (e.g., `setEndtDate` was corrected to `setEndDate`).
