### Key Points:
- **Ownership Control**: Functions that modify the state or withdraw funds are protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier.
- **Fallback Function**: Modified to prevent non-view calls and to ensure proper forwarding of data.
- **Miner Role**: Added `onlyMinerOrOwner` modifier for functions that should be accessible by either the miner or the owner.
- **Function Implementation**: Placeholder comments are left where specific Tellor methods need to be called, as the exact interface or method names may vary based on the actual Tellor contract.
