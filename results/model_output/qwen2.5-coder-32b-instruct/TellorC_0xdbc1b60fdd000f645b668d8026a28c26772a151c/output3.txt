Below is the completed `TellorC` smart contract according to your specifications. The implementation includes proper access control checks, functionality for interacting with the Tellor system as described, and ensuring the fallback function behaves as intended.

```solidity

This contract now correctly implements the functions as described and includes the necessary access controls to ensure that sensitive operations can only be performed by the owner or, in the case of submitting mining solutions, by the miner as well. The fallback function is modified to prevent non-view calls.
