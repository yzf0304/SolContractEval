    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Initial Pauser**: The pauser is set to the contract deployer during the constructor.
- **Pause and Unpause Functions**: These functions toggle the `paused` state of the contract and emit respective events.
- **Pauser Role Management**: Only the owner can change the pauser role.
- **Modifiers**: 
  - `whenNotPaused`: Ensures the function cannot be called while the contract is paused.
  - `onlyPauser`: Restricts function calls to the pauser role.
  
This contract meets the requirements specified in the task and aligns with the provided context and description.
