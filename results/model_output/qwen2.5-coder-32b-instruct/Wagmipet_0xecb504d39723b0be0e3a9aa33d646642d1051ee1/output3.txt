This contract includes all the required functionalities to manage a virtual pet's needs (hunger, uncleanliness, boredom, sleepiness) and provides appropriate feedback through the `getStatus()` method. It also ensures the game mechanics are implemented correctly, such as preventing actions when the pet is dead or overly affected by its needs.
