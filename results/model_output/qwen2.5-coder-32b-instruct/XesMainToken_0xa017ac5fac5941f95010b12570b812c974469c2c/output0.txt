Your `StandardToken` contract implementation appears correct based on the ERC20 standard and the context provided. However, there are a few minor adjustments needed to ensure compatibility with Solidity version 0.4.19 and to follow best practices for that version:

1. **Event Syntax**: In Solidity 0.4.19, the syntax for emitting events involves using the `emit` keyword, which was introduced in Solidity 0.4.11.
2. **Var Keyword**: The `var` keyword is deprecated and should be avoided. Instead, always specify the type explicitly.

Here's the corrected version of your contract:

```solidity
/**
 * @title StandardToken
 * @dev Implementation of the basic standard token with ERC20 and SafeMath.
 * @notice This contract provides a standard implementation of an ERC20 token, including transfer, transferFrom, approve, and allowance functions.
 */
contract StandardToken is ERC20, SafeMath {

    mapping (address => uint) balances;

    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) allowed;

    /**
     * @notice Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from the message sender to `_to`.
     * @param _to The address to which the tokens will be transferred.
     * @param _value The amount of tokens to be transferred.
     * @return A boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
     * @dev Emits a Transfer event and uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations.
     */
    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool success) {
        balances[msg.sender] = safeSub(balances[msg.sender], _value);
        balances[_to] = safeAdd(balances[_to], _value);
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value); // Use emit for triggering events
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from `_from` to `_to`, using the allowance mechanism.
     * @param _from The address from which the tokens will be transferred.
     * @param _to The address to which the tokens will be transferred.
     * @param _value The amount of tokens to be transferred.
     * @return A boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
     * @dev Emits a Transfer event, updates the allowance, and uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations.
     */
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) public returns (bool success) {
        uint _allowance = allowed[_from][msg.sender]; // Explicitly declare variable type
        balances[_to] = safeAdd(balances[_to], _value);
        balances[_from] = safeSub(balances[_from], _value);
        allowed[_from][msg.sender] = safeSub(_allowance, _value);
        emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value); // Use emit for triggering events
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Returns the balance of the `_owner` address.
     * @param _owner The address whose balance is to be queried.
     * @return The balance of the `_owner` address.
     * @dev This function is constant and does not modify the state.
     */
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public constant returns (uint balance) {
        return balances[_owner];
    }

    /**
     * @notice Approves `_spender` to spend up to `_value` amount of tokens on behalf of the message sender.
     * @param _spender The address that is being approved to spend the tokens.
     * @param _value The maximum amount of tokens that can be spent.
     * @return A boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
     * @dev Emits an Approval event. Be aware of the risks associated with setting the allowance to 0 before calling this function.
     */
    function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public returns (bool success) {
        allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value); // Use emit for triggering events
        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Returns the remaining amount of tokens that `_spender` is allowed to spend on behalf of `_owner`.
     * @param _owner The address that owns the tokens.
     * @param _spender The address that is allowed to spend the tokens.
     * @return The remaining amount of tokens that `_spender` is allowed to spend.
     * @dev This function is constant and does not modify the state.
     */
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public constant returns (uint remaining) {
        return allowed[_owner][_spender];
    }
}
```

This revised contract should work correctly with Solidity 0.4.19 and adhere to best practices for that version.
